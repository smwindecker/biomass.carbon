Leaf economics spectrum theory suggests that a range of functional traits correlate along a spectrum of nutrient level that can be used to generalise litter quality. Excluded among this suite of traits are direct measures of carbon composition of litter, despite their relevance to a range of ecosystem processes including decomposition. In this study, we measure morphologicl and chemical traits across the economics spectrum as well as relative carbon composition and ask how these traits covary. In total, we measure seven traits for 29 wetland plant species: litter area per mass, dry matter content, nitrogen content, total carbon, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin content. We use thermogravimetric analysis to estimate the relative composition of the carbon compounds. To replace proprietary software currently used in the modelling step of this estimation technique, we demonstrate use of an open-source statistical R package called `mixchar' that we developed for this purpose. Litter chemistry varied by functional group: terrestrial dry species had the highest lignin concentration and emergent amphibious and terrestrial damp species had the highest cellulose concentration. Litter area per mass, dry matter content, and nitrogen content were correlated along a single plane, as predicted according to leaf economics spectrum theory. In general, species invested in predominantly lignin- or cellulose- based tissue, and variation along this spectrum of carbon complexity was orthogonal in multivariate trait space to the economics spectrum traits. This decoupling supports using multiple traits when using traits to predict ecosystem processes such as decomposition.
