  abstract = {Response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to global climate change can have important implications to future environment. Soil organic carbon models that provide reliable predictions of SOC change in response to changing management, vegetation, and climatic conditions can serve as useful tools for developing and assessing land management practices that improve soil quality and sustainability and promote soil carbon sequestration. Most models of SOC dynamics based on the concepts of homogeneous SOC compartments face the problem of disconnection between conceptual kinetic SOC compartments and measurable SOC fractions. In addition, most kinetic parameters cannot be determined experimentally for specific site and soil conditions. Feng (2009) developed a new theoretical framework of SOC dynamics based on three fundamental assumptions: the possibility of steady state, linearity, and rate-time equivalence. A single SOC decomposition function, the R function, forms the basis of SOC prediction. This article develops the mathematical theory of a process-based, continuous model (K-model) of the R function. The model is developed by considering three basic steps in SOC decomposition: the initial decomposition of plant litter and utilization of its carbon by soil microorganisms, death of microorganisms, and decomposition and recycling of dead microbial residues. Death of microorganisms and subsequent decomposition of the dead microbial residue form a continuous cycle (the MD cycle) that leads to stabilization of C in soils. The model identifies a specific set of parameters that can be determined experimentally, making possible for site-specific parameterization and simulation.},

  volume = {230},
  issn = {0022-5193},
  abstract = {Radiocarbon measurements have been used in combination with ``bomb 14C'' models to estimate turnover of soil organic carbon fractions. However, the bomb 14C models assume that all SOC fractions are formed directly from external inputs of carbon, which is not always valid because some SOC fractions may receive carbon from other SOC fractions. Due to the continuous inputs of organic carbon, we argue that the most appropriate way to describe the age of SOC is by an age distribution. We developed age distributed models of SOC fractions and derived analytical solutions to them. The models all assume that SOC fraction decay can be described by first-order kinetics, but differ in their assumptions about the pathway of SOC fraction formation. The solutions can be used to estimate age distributions at steady state of different SOC fractions based on their radiocarbon content. These age distributions can be used to calculate the mean age, mean residence time, and other vital statistics of each measurable SOC fraction. Furthermore, if a sequential scheme is used to isolate the SOC fractions, an estimated age distribution of the total SOC can be obtained by adding the contributions of each soil fraction. The age distributions can be very helpful in interpretations of soil organic carbon dynamics in different soils.},

  abstract = {[Aim To compare the internal balances of nutrients and the rates of nutrient cycling across nine cocoa agroforestry systems consisting of various combination of soil types (Latosols and Cambisols), production systems (cabruca and Erythrina glauca-shade) and fertilization regimes in southern Bahia, Brazil. Methods We measured nutrient stocks in litter fall production, in the accumulated litter and fruits. The internal nutrient balance for various simulations was obtained by the following expressions: (1) Balance 1=litter - fruit (seeds and husks) and (2) Balance 2=(litter+husks) - seeds. Annual litter decomposition coefficients (k) and subsequent potential of nutrient release were also investigated. The data were analyzed by principal components analysis and by Pearson correlations. Results There was a high degree of dissimilarity among the cocoa agrosystems in relation to the nutrient cycling and the internal nutrient balance. The mean annual litterfall production ranged from 4.6 to 8.5 Mg/ha, and the amount of accumulated litter ranged from 7.7 to 16.8 Mg/ha. The results showed significant differences in quality among litter from cocoa agroforests; the decomposition coefficient of litter and the subsequent nutrient release were regulated by the litter quality. In general, the cocoa-erythrina system presented a higher capacity to recycle nutrients compared to the cocoa-cabruca system, with the cocoa-erythrina system having the largest transfer rate of nutrients through litterfall, high values for the decomposition coefficient of litter and the lowest values for the Mean Residence Time of nutrients. Cocoa tree leaves functioned as a sink of nutrients, while shade tree leaves functioned predominantly as a source. The nutritional reserves of litter+ cocoa fruit husks, with respect only to the nutrients exported in the seeds, the balance was positive for all nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) in all agroforests, which emphasizes the potential productive capacity of these agroforests to sustain the estimated production in different harvest cycles. Conclusions The internal balance of nutrients reflects an agroforests's productive capacity, which accumulated litter and cocoa fruit husks may be important nutrient sources that could enable the development of fertilizer recommendation systems aimed at increasing the efficiency of fertilizer use and at maintaining soil fertility in cocoa agroforests. Therefore, further research is needed to develop nutritional balance systems integrating litter+fruits stock and other nutrient pathways (e.g., soil quality, biological N fixation, leaching), which were not measured, for making recommendations regarding liming and fertilizers that are suitable for highly complex biological agrosystems, such as cocoa agroforests that have low levels of elements exported during seed production.]},

The 14C basal age of dried peat is not different from the 14C basal age of bog peat, which supports the theory that dried peat formed from bog peat. A novel application of 210Pb dating links the timing of this change with the introduction of livestock to Wellington Plain in the mid-1800s. Physical loss of material appears to have been the dominant process removing material as bog peats drained to form dried peats, as indicated by the mass balances of carbon and lead.

Wetland hydrology, age, and management can affect primary productivity, decomposition, and ultimately C sequestration in riverine wetlands, but these aspects of wetland biogeochemistry have not been adequately investigated, especially in created wetlands. In this study we investigate the ability of created freshwater wetlands to sequester C by determining the sediment accretion and soil C accumulation of two 15-yr-old created wetlands in central Ohio-one planted and one naturally colonized. We measured the amount of sediment and soil C accumulated over the parent material and found that these created wetlands accumulated an average of 242 g C m yr, 70\% more than a similar natural wetland in the region and 26\% more than the rate estimated for these same wetlands 5 yr before this study. The C sequestration of the naturally colonized wetland was 22\% higher than that of the planted wetland (267 {$\pm$} 17 vs. 219 {$\pm$} 15 g C m yr, respectively). Soil C accrual accounted for 66\% of the aboveground net primary productivity on average. Open water communities had the highest C accumulation rates in both wetlands. This study shows that created wetlands can be natural, cost-effective tools to sequester C to mitigate the effect of greenhouse gas emissions.},

  volume = {120},

  abstract = {Globally, wetlands provide the largest terrestrial carbon (C) store, and restoration of degraded wetlands provides a potentially important mechanism for climate change mitigation. We examined the potential for restored saltmarshes to sequester carbon, and found that they can provide a modest, but sustained, sink for atmospheric CO2. Rates of C and nutrient cycling were measured and compared between a natural saltmarsh (high- and low-shore locations), claimed arable land on former high-shore saltmarsh and a managed realignment restoration site (high- and low-shore) in transition from agricultural land to saltmarsh 15 years after realignment, at Tollesbury, Essex, UK. We measured pools and turnover of C and nitrogen (N) in soil and vegetation at each site using a range of methods, including gas flux measurement and isotopic labelling. The natural high-shore site had the highest soil organic matter concentrations, topsoil C stock and below-ground biomass, whereas the agricultural site had the highest total extractable N concentration and lowest soil C/N ratio. Ecosystem respiration rates were similar across all three high-shore sites, but much higher in both low-shore sites, which receive regular inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the estuary. Total evolution of 14C-isotopically labelled substrate as CO2 was highest at the agricultural site, suggesting that low observed respiration rates here were due to low substrate supply (following a recent harvest) rather than to inherently low microbial activity. The results suggest that, after 15 years, the managed realignment site is not fully equivalent to the natural saltmarsh in terms of biological and chemical function. While above ground biomass, extractable N and substrate mineralisation rates in the high-shore site were all quite similar to the natural site, less dynamic ecosystem properties including soil C stock, C/N ratio and below-ground biomass all remained more similar to the agricultural site. These results suggest that reversion to natural biogeochemical functioning will occur following restoration, but is likely to be slow; we estimate that it will take approximately 100 years for the restored site to accumulate the amount of C currently stored in the natural site, at a rate of 0.92 t C ha-1 yr-1. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Large wood, both live and dead, is essential for producing complex habitat in many streams, especially in forested watersheds that support salmonid populations. The addition of engineered wood structures is a common approach taken in many streams where past watershed management practices have resulted in reduced wood loading. We examined six 300-m stream reaches in the Lagunitas Creek watershed, Northern California, to determine (i) the distribution of large wood in the bankfull channel and 10-year floodplain, (ii) the influence of large wood on the size and distribution of pools and (iii) whether streams with engineered wood structures had greater diversity of pool habitat to support salmonid populations. We found that the amount of large wood in the bankfull channel and the amount available for recruitment from the 10-year floodplain were highly variable among and within reaches examined and largely dependent on the local geomorphic setting. Stream reaches with engineered wood structures had elevated pool frequencies relative to reaches without these structures, suggesting a higher capacity to support salmonids during critical life stages. Among large wood pieces that had a strong influence on pool formation, 23\% had an attached root wad and 66\% were part of a cluster. All of the study reaches we examined had lower volumes of large wood in their bankfull channels than similar stream types with natural wood-loading levels, suggesting that increased additions of large wood could provide ecosystem benefits over time. These principles can be understood and transferred effectively to other watersheds using a framework of wood-loading process domains. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Tussocks formed by Carex stricta are a relatively large carbon (C) pool in sedge meadows, but the stability of organic matter in these ecosystems is not well understood. We initiated year-long incubation experiments (22.5\textdegree{}C) to evaluate the CO2 and CH4 production potentials of sedge meadow substrates under field moist and inundated treatments from five sites in the Upper Midwest, USA (4 reference, 1 restored). C mineralization potentials decreased with depth (tussocks{$>$}underlying soil), and were positively correlated with macro-organic matter content and negatively with lignin. Across sites, C stored in tussocks and soil at the restoration was the least stable, suggesting that the restoration of C-storage function may take decades. Mineralization potentials were similar between field moist and inundated treatments, but inundation resulted in higher methane production, accounting for 24\textendash{}51\% of total carbon mineralized from tussocks. In the field however, C. stricta tussocks emitted less methane (393{$\pm$}76mgCH4m-2d-1) than tussock interspaces (1362{$\pm$}371mgCH4m-2d-1) early in the growing season; we suggest that tussock tops oxidized methane produced from deeper anoxic horizons. Our results highlight the importance of considering how microtopography modulates greenhouse gas flux from wetlands and suggests that the C stored in the older, more decomposed C. stricta tussock sedge meadow substrates (both within and between sites) is relatively stable.},

  shorttitle = {Predicting Changes in Community Composition and Ecosystem Functioning from Plant Traits},
  abstract = {* 1The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary.
* 2We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters.
* 3To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability.
* 4We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes.
* 5This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

  abstract = {In this study, we used data from temperate grassland plant communities in Alberta, Canada to test two longstanding hypotheses in ecology: 1) that there has been correlated evolution of the leaves and roots of plants due to selection for an integrated whole-plant resource uptake strategy, and 2) that trait diversity in ecological communities is generated by adaptations to the conditions in different habitats. We tested the first hypothesis using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for evidence of correlated evolution of suites of leaf and root functional traits in these grasslands. There were consistent evolutionary correlations among traits related to plant resource uptake strategies within leaf tissues, and within root tissues. In contrast, there were inconsistent correlations between the traits of leaves and the traits of roots, suggesting different evolutionary pressures on the above and belowground components of plant morphology. To test the second hypothesis, we evaluated the relative importance of two components of trait diversity: within-community variation (species trait values relative to co-occurring species; {$\alpha$} traits) and among-community variation (the average trait value in communities where species occur; {$\beta$} traits). Trait diversity was mostly explained by variation among co-occurring species, not among-communities. Additionally, there was a phylogenetic signal in the within-community trait values of species relative to co-occurring taxa, but not in their habitat associations or among-community trait variation. These results suggest that sorting of pre-existing trait variation into local communities can explain the leaf and root trait diversity in these grasslands.},

  abstract = {Abstract Leaves and absorptive roots (i.e., first?order root) are above? and belowground plant organs related to resource acquisition; however, it is controversy over whether these two sets of functional traits vary in a coordinated manner. Here, we examined the relationships between analogous above? and belowground traits, including chemical (tissue C and N concentrations) and morphological traits (thickness and diameter, specific leaf area and root length, and tissue density) of 154 species sampling from eight subtropical and temperate forests. Our results showed that N concentrations of leaves and absorptive roots were positively correlated independent of phylogeny and plant growth forms, whereas morphological traits between above? and belowground organs varied independently. These results indicate that, different from plant economics spectrum theory, there is a complex integration of diverse adaptive strategies of plant species to above? and belowground environments, with convergent adaptation in nutrient traits but divergence in morphological traits across plant organs. Our results offer a new perspective for understanding the resource capture strategies of plants in adaptation to heterogeneous environments, and stress the importance of phylogenetic consideration in the discussion of cross?species trait relationships.},

  abstract = {Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

  shorttitle = {Priming Effect},
  abstract = {Understanding how ecosystems store or release carbon is one of ecology's greatest challenges in the 21st century. Organic matter covers a large range of chemical structures and qualities, and it is classically represented by pools of different recalcitrance to degradation. The interaction effects of these pools on carbon cycling are still poorly understood and are most often ignored in global-change models. Soil scientists have shown that inputs of labile organic matter frequently tend to increase, and often double, the mineralization of the more recalcitrant organic matter. The recent revival of interest for this phenomenon, named the priming effect, did not cross the frontiers of the disciplines. In particular, the priming effect phenomenon has been almost totally ignored by the scientific communities studying marine and continental aquatic ecosystems. Here we gather several arguments, experimental results, and field observations that strongly support the hypothesis that the priming effect is a general phenomenon that occurs in various terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. For example, the increase in recalcitrant organic matter mineralization rate in the presence of labile organic matter ranged from 10\% to 500\% in six studies on organic matter degradation in aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, the recalcitrant organic matter mineralization rate may largely depend on labile organic matter availability, influencing the CO{$_2$} emissions of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We suggest that (1) recalcitrant organic matter may largely contribute to the CO{$_2$} emissions of aquatic ecosystems through the priming effect, and (2) priming effect intensity may be modified by global changes, interacting with eutrophication processes and atmospheric CO{$_2$} increases. Finally, we argue that the priming effect acts substantially in the carbon and nutrient cycles in all ecosystems. We outline exciting avenues for research, which could provide new insights on the responses of ecosystems to anthropogenic perturbations and their feedbacks to climatic changes.},

  issn = {0022-0477},
  abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a 'plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic 'leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},

  shorttitle = {Multiple Mechanisms for Trait Effects on Litter Decomposition},
  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}Evidence is growing that leaf litter generally decomposes faster than expected in its environment of origin, owing to specialization of litter and topsoil decomposer communities to break down litter encountered most often. Nevertheless, this home-field advantage (HFA) in decomposition is inconsistently supported by experimental data and fails to account for situations where contrasting qualities of litter coexist within the same litter matrix. 2.\hspace{0.6em}In contrast to the HFA hypothesis, which expects a positive interaction between every litter species produced locally and the local decomposer communities irrespective of litter species quality, we define here an alternative substrate quality\textendash{}matrix quality interaction (SMI) hypothesis that expects a continuum from positive to negative interaction between specific litters (substrates) and decomposer communities as specific litters and the ecosystem litter layer (i.e. the matrix, which drives local decomposer community composition) become increasingly dissimilar in quality. 3.\hspace{0.6em}To test this hypothesis, we conducted a reciprocal transplant decomposition experiment of eight leaf, six fine-stem and nine fine-root litter species from three neighbouring ecosystems of the subarctic biome: dry forest, riparian forest and forest-surrounded pond; and characterized the quality (represented by lignin content and an integrated measure of carbon/nutrient economics) of each litter species and each ecosystem litter layer. 4.\hspace{0.6em}We found substantial overall effects of SMI on decomposition rates of leaf (20\% explained variance), stem (14\%) and root (15\%) litters, although this effect was lower than the single effects of litter quality and microclimate (remaining explained variance). Despite being partly inconsistent across litter species, likely due to the complexity of litter quality\textendash{}decomposer community relationships, the SMI hypothesis appeared more broadly applicable than the HFA hypothesis. 5.Synthesis.\hspace{0.6em}We demonstrate here that plant traits, likely via their control on litter and topsoil decomposer community composition, have indirect effects on litter breakdown rates, not only at the interface between ecosystems but also within ecosystems, with likely implications for many other ecosystems world-wide. These results suggest functional variation in decomposer communities between ecosystems with respect to their efficiency to degrade litters with contrasting qualities, such as different lignolytic and detoxification activities but also contrasting efficiencies to degrade non-recalcitrant tissues.},

  volume = {85},
  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {Most predictions of plant species effects on ecosystems are based on single traits (e.g., litter chemistry) or suites of related traits (functional groups). However, recent studies demonstrate that predictions of species effects on ecosystems are improved by considering multiple traits. In order to develop this multiple trait approach, it is critical to understand how these multiple traits vary in relation to one another among species. The ecosystem effects of traits that strongly covary can likely be summarized by one of these traits. In contrast, it will be necessary to determine the ecosystem effects of specific trait combinations for those traits that vary independently across species. In the field, I established monocultures of eight herbaceous species common in California annual grasslands. Plant species significantly differed in their litter quantity and quality, live biomass, and effects on soil labile C, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Species effects on soil moisture and temperature were only significant at the times of the growing season when each of these limited plant and microbial activity. Some of these traits correlated with one another, such as litter biomass and species effects on soil temperature during the winter. However, for the most part, plant species exhibited unique combinations of these traits. For example, species with similar litter chemistry had the largest differences in plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil labile C. Species rankings for many traits changed over the growing season (e.g., biomass), so that the relationship among traits varied seasonally. The independent variation of these traits suggests that predictions of plant species effects on ecosystems will likely be enhanced by an understanding of how the ecosystem effects of plant traits may vary depending on the combination of traits.},

In this study, we fitted statistical models to explain landscape-scale variation in soil microbial community composition using data from 180 sites covering a broad range of grassland types, soil and climatic conditions in England. We found that variation in soil microbial communities was explained by abiotic factors like climate, pH and soil properties. Biotic factors, namely community-weighted means (CWM) of plant functional traits, also explained variation in soil microbial communities. In particular, more bacterial-dominated microbial communities were associated with exploitative plant traits versus fungal-dominated communities with resource-conservative traits, showing that plant functional traits and soil microbial communities are closely related at the landscape scale.},

  shorttitle = {Decomposition Trajectories of Diverse Litter Types},
  abstract = {* Decomposition of plant litter is a key process in the global carbon cycle, and its realistic representation is essential for accurate prediction of ecosystem carbon and nutrient dynamics. Traditionally, the exponential decay model, which assumes a constant relative decomposition rate through time, has been widely used for both the analysis of empirical data and large-scale modelling. While this model may be adequate in some contexts, there are also many empirical observations for which it does not fit the data well.

* Using a number of previously published leaf and wood decomposition data sets, comprising a diverse selection of litters, we compared the performance of five simple decay models varying in complexity and functional form. To accomplish this, we used a combination of model selection criteria and out-of-sample extrapolation analyses.

* Model selection criteria favoured an optimal balance between parsimony and flexibility, and a rarely used model built on the Weibull distribution proved to have sufficient flexibility to fit the full range of decomposition trajectories including litters that show an initial lag phase. Using the Weibull fits, we further showed that the litter N content affects the shape of the decomposition trajectory, a novel biological result. Out-of-sample extrapolation showed biased predictions for all models and estimates of steady-state stocks were often highly sensitive to model choice.

* As the field moves beyond the single-pool exponential framework, it is useful to confront alternate models with data from a wide array of litter types. This analysis demonstrates that model flexibility is important for representing the wide array of possible decomposition dynamics encountered in nature, with lag phase dynamics more widespread than previously thought. Out-of-sample extrapolation and derived parameters that rely on it remain problematic with all tested models. Progress in understanding the drivers and consequences of litter decomposition will come from combining empirical approaches with more focused process-based modelling that allow for the assessment of alternative model assumptions.},

  issn = {0168-6445},
  shorttitle = {Living in a Fungal World},
  abstract = {The colonization of land by plants appears to have coincided with the appearance of mycorrhiza-like fungi. Over evolutionary time, fungi have maintained their prominent role in the formation of mycorrhizal associations. In addition, however, they have been able to occupy other terrestrial niches of which the decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter is perhaps the most remarkable. This implies that, in contrast to that of aquatic organic matter decomposition, bacteria have not been able to monopolize decomposition processes in terrestrial ecosystems. The emergence of fungi in terrestrial ecosystems must have had a strong impact on the evolution of terrestrial bacteria. On the one hand, potential decomposition niches, e.g. lignin degradation, have been lost for bacteria, whereas on the other hand the presence of fungi has itself created new bacterial niches. Confrontation between bacteria and fungi is ongoing, and from studying contemporary interactions, we can learn about the impact that fungi presently have, and have had in the past, on the ecology and evolution of terrestrial bacteria. In the first part of this review, the focus is on niche differentiation between soil bacteria and fungi involved in the decomposition of plant-derived organic matter. Bacteria and fungi are seen to compete for simple plant-derived substrates and have developed antagonistic strategies. For more recalcitrant organic substrates, e.g. cellulose and lignin, both competitive and mutualistic strategies appear to have evolved. In the second part of the review, bacterial niches with respect to the utilization of fungal-derived substrates are considered. Here, several lines of development can be recognized, ranging from mutualistic exudate-consuming bacteria that are associated with fungal surfaces to endosymbiotic and mycophagous bacteria. In some cases, there are indications of fungal specific selection in fungus-associated bacteria, and possible mechanisms for such selection are discussed.},

  shorttitle = {Stabilization of Organic Matter in Temperate Soils},
  abstract = {Mechanisms for C stabilization in soils have received much interest recently due to their relevance in the global C cycle. Here we review the mechanisms that are currently, but often contradictorily or inconsistently, considered to contribute to organic matter (OM) protection against decomposition in temperate soils: (i) selective preservation due to recalcitrance of OM, including plant litter, rhizodeposits, microbial products, humic polymers, and charred OM; (ii) spatial inaccessibility of OM against decomposer organisms due to occlusion, intercalation, hydrophobicity and encapsulation; and (iii) stabilization by interaction with mineral surfaces (Fe-, Al-, Mn-oxides, phyllosilicates) and metal ions. Our goal is to assess the relevance of these mechanisms to the formation of soil OM during different stages of decomposition and under different soil conditions. The view that OM stabilization is dominated by the selective preservation of recalcitrant organic components that accumulate in proportion to their chemical properties can no longer be accepted. In contrast, our analysis of mechanisms shows that: (i) the soil biotic community is able to disintegrate any OM of natural origin; (ii) molecular recalcitrance of OM is relative, rather than absolute; (iii) recalcitrance is only important during early decomposition and in active surface soils; while (iv) during late decomposition and in the subsoil, the relevance of spatial inaccessibility and organo-mineral interactions for SOM stabilization increases. We conclude that major difficulties in the understanding and prediction of SOM dynamics originate from the simultaneous operation of several mechanisms. We discuss knowledge gaps and promising directions of future research.},

  shorttitle = {Litter Quality Is in the Eye of the Beholder},
  abstract = {* 1The chemical composition of plant litter is commonly considered to indicate its quality as a resource for decomposer organisms. Litter quality, defined in this way, has been shown to be a major determinant of litter decomposition rates both within and across terrestrial ecosystems. Notably, the structure of the microbial community that is directly responsible for primary decomposition is rarely considered as an empirical predictor of litter decay rates.
* 2Microbial communities are generally assumed to perceive litters of the same chemical composition to be of equivalent resource quality but evidence from field studies suggests that these same communities may adapt to the prevalent litter types at a given site. Here, we tested this assumption by assessing how microbial communities sourced from different forest- and herbaceous-dominated ecosystems perceive the quality of novel, foliar litters derived from a tree (Rhododendron maximum) and from a grass (Panicum virgatum) species. Based on chemical composition, we would expect R. maximum litter to be of lower quality than P. virgatum litter.
* 3We used an experimental litter\textendash{}soil system which employs a `common garden' approach and measured rates of CO2 production across 50~days; higher rates of production were assumed to indicate higher quality (i.e. more easily degradable) litter.
* 4We found that communities sourced from habitats under differing plant cover perceived litter quality differently. Those communities sourced from herbaceous habitats perceived the grass litter to be of higher quality than the tree litter, whereas communities from forest habitats decomposed both litter types similarly. Within a litter type, differences in both community composition and nutrient availability of the source habitat were related to decomposition rates.
* 5Our results suggest that litter quality cannot necessarily be predicted solely from chemical characteristics; instead the perceived quality is dependent on the quality of past resource inputs a community has experienced and the structure of those microbial communities responsible for the initial stages of litter decomposition.},

Dolomite is a double carbonate containing calcium and magnesium carbonate in equimolar concentrations. All three carbonates decompose via a single stage process in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The thermal behavior and the kinetics of decomposition were studied using the Arrhenius equation applied to solid-state reactions. It was found that calcite and dolomite supposedly decompose via a zero order mechanism while magnesite decomposes via a first order process. The energy of activation for the decomposition of magnesite, calcite and dolomite were 226.34, 192.50 and 175.05kJ/mol, respectively. Similarly the lnA-values for magnesite, calcite and dolomite decomposition were 30.70, 20.73 and 18.76, respectively. Finally, the effect of procedural variables on the kinetic parameters of dolomite decomposition was investigated. The three procedural variables studied included flow rate, heating rate and sample size. The kinetic parameters and mechanism remain unaffected by a change in these variables.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 2001, MrBayes has grown in popularity as a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site dN/dS rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

  volume = {120},
  issn = {00380717},
  shorttitle = {The Root of the Matter},
  abstract = {Plant roots contribute substantially to the formation of stable soil organic matter (SOM), and there is evidence that species differ in their contribution to SOM stabilization. However, it remains unclear what specific root traits contribute to the three SOM stabilization mechanisms: recalcitrance against decomposition, occlusion in soil aggregates and interaction with soil minerals and metals. This is likely because research is highly fragmented and hampered by disciplinary barriers. By reviewing both plant functional ecology and soil science literature, we identified 18 different traits: architectural, morphological, physiological, symbiotic and chemical root characteristics, influencing the three SOM stabilization mechanisms. We found that traits increasing root recalcitrance promote short term stabilization by slowing decomposition, but that traits reducing recalcitrance contribute to long term stabilization by reaction of microbial products with mineral surfaces. Root length density, mycorrhizal association and rhizodeposition contribute to microaggregation. These and other traits, such as hemicellulose, soluble compounds, and high root branching index, favor macroaggregation. For stabilization by minerals and metals, those root traits promoting higher microbial activity: root nitrogen, hemicellulose and soluble compound concentrations are fundamental, while polyphenols, and litter Al and Mn also contribute to complexification and stabilization. Root depth distribution is the most important trait to control root C storage and stabilization in the subsoil; once roots have reached deeper soil layers, other traits, such as rhizodeposition and root chemistry, influence interaction with minerals and metals. Both mycorrhizal presence and root suberin promote SOC stabilization by means of all three mechanisms, indicating that these are important targets for continued work. Surprisingly, morphological traits commonly measured, namely specific root length and root diameter, poorly relate to stabilization mechanisms. Alternative traits such as chemical composition of the different root orders, root apex characteristics, quantity and quality of rhizodeposits as well as mycorrhizal fungal traits, should be further investigated. For future research, this review highlights the need to evaluate root decomposition and root-C stabilization concomitantly over the long-term, considering simultaneously root litter quality, estimated by root traits, the microbial products and properties of the soil matrix. The information accrued in this review can be used to evaluate the potential of plant species and cultivars to promote SOM stabilization, based on their root traits.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}Global change is likely to alter plant community structure, with consequences for the structure and functioning of the below-ground community and potential feedbacks to climate change. Understanding the mechanisms behind these plant\textendash{}soil interactions and feedbacks to the Earth-system is therefore crucial. One approach to understanding such mechanisms is to use plant traits as predictors of functioning. 2.\hspace{0.6em}We used a field-based monoculture experiment involving nine grassland species that had been growing on the same base soil for 7~years to test whether leaf, litter and root traits associated with different plant growth strategies can be linked to an extensive range of soil properties relevant to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Soil properties included the biomass and structure of the soil microbial community, soil nutrients, soil microclimate and soil process rates. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Plant species with a high relative growth rate (RGR) were associated with high leaf and litter quality (e.g. low toughness, high nitrogen concentrations), an elevated biomass of bacteria relative to fungi in soil, high rates of soil nitrogen mineralization and concentrations of extractable inorganic nitrogen, and to some extent higher available phosphorus pools. 4.\hspace{0.6em}In contrast to current theory, species with a high RGR and litter quality were associated with soils with a lower rate of soil respiration and slow decomposition rates. This indicates that predicting processes that influence carbon cycling from plant traits may be more complex than predicting processes that influence nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. 5.\hspace{0.6em}Root traits did not show strong relationships to RGR, leaf or litter traits, but were strongly correlated with several soil properties, particularly the biomass of bacteria relative to fungi in soil and measures relating to soil carbon cycling. 6.\hspace{0.6em}Synthesis. Our results indicate that plant species from a single habitat can result in significant divergence in soil properties and functioning when grown in monoculture, and that many of these changes are strongly and predictably linked to variation in plant traits associated with different growth strategies. Traits therefore have the potential to be a powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms behind plant\textendash{}soil interactions and ecosystem functioning, and for predicting how changes in plant species composition associated with global change will feedback to the Earth-system.},

  volume = {380},

  abstract = {The pyrolysis of lignocellulosic materials (pine and eucalyptus woods and pine bark) was previously studied by thermogravimetry with linear temperature programming. The results were successfully modelled by a kinetic scheme consisting of three independent first-order reactions of three pseudo-components. The first and the second pseudo-components correspond to the more-reactive fractions of hemicellulose and cellulose, respectively, and the third includes lignin and the remaining fractions of the carbohydrates. In the present work, the isothermal pyrolysis of lignocellulosic materials (in the temperature range 450\textendash{}700K) was simulated using the previously determined kinetic parameters, yielding their corresponding relative reactivities. The reactivity of each pseudo-component was also studied, and it was found out that the first pseudo-component was completely converted in a very short time at medium and high temperatures, while complete conversion of the second required high temperatures. The reactivity of the third pseudo-component is moderate, even at the highest temperatures. Based on these observations, a method to determine pyrolysis kinetics from isothermal thermogravimetric experiments was developed, whereby the kinetic and composition parameters corresponding to pseudo-components 3, 2 and 1 are successively and independently determined, from high, medium and low temperature experiments, respectively. The method was validated using the isothermal thermogravimetric curves simulated for the three materials.},

A full reciprocal litter transplant study with 16 litter species that varied widely in traits and originated from four forest sites covering a large latitudinal gradient (subarctic to tropics) showed a consistent interspecific ranking of decomposition rates. At a global scale, variation in decomposition was driven by a small subset of litter traits (water saturation capacity and concentrations of magnesium and condensed tannins). These consistent findings, that were largely independent of the varying local decomposer communities, suggest that decomposer communities show little specialisation and high metabolic flexibility in processing plant litter, irrespective of litter origin. Our results provide strong support for using trait-based approaches in modelling the global decomposition component of biosphere-atmosphere carbon fluxes.},

  abstract = {Background:Plant functional traits co-vary along strategy spectra, thereby defining trade-offs for resource acquisition and utilization amongst other processes. A main objective of plant ecology is to quantify the correlations among traits and ask why some of them are sufficiently closely coordinated to form a single axis of functional specialization. However, due to trait co-variations in nature, it is difficult to propose a mechanistic and causal explanation for the origin of trade-offs among traits observed at both intra- and inter-specific level. Methodology/Principal Findings:Using the Gemini individual-centered model which coordinates physiological and morphological processes, we investigated with 12 grass species the consequences of deliberately decoupling variation of leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf lifespan) and plant stature (height and tiller number) on plant growth and phenotypic variability. For all species under both high and low N supplies, simulated trait values maximizing plant growth in monocultures matched observed trait values. Moreover, at the intraspecific level, plastic trait responses to N addition predicted by the model were in close agreement with observed trait responses. In a 4D trait space, our modeling approach highlighted that the unique trait combination maximizing plant growth under a given environmental condition was determined by a coordination of leaf, root and whole plant processes that tended to co-limit the acquisition and use of carbon and of nitrogen. Conclusion/Significance:Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the origin of trade-offs between plant functional traits and further predicts plasticity in plant traits in response to environmental changes. In a multidimensional trait space, regions occupied by current plant species can therefore be viewed as adaptive corridors where trait combinations minimize allometric and physiological constraints from the organ to the whole plant levels. The regions outside this corridor are empty because of inferior plant performance.},

  issn = {1365-2664},
  abstract = {1. River regulation and exotic plant invasion threaten riverine ecosystems, and the two often co-occur. By altering water regimes, flow regulation can facilitate plant invasion by providing conditions that directly benefit invading species, or by reducing competition from native species unsuited to the modified conditions. Integrating water and weed management has the potential to limit riparian plant invasion and maximize the ecological benefit of environmental flows. 2. We surveyed plant communities and modelled flood histories of 24 riparian wetlands along the regulated River Murray, south-eastern Australia. There were no suitable control rivers, so we compared modelled pre- and post-regulation hydrological data to quantify hydrological change in the study wetlands. Regression analyses revealed relationships between hydrological modification and cover of native non-weed, native weed and exotic weed groups and 10 individual species. 3. Exotic cover was highest and native non-weed cover lowest in wetlands that had experienced the greatest change in hydrology \textendash{} a reduction in peak flow. Native weeds did not respond to hydrological modification indicating that exotic species' success was not reliant on their generalist characteristics. 4. By altering habitat filters, hydrological modification caused a decline in amphibious native non-weed species cover and simultaneously provided drier conditions that directly favoured the exotic species group dominated by terrestrial species. Exotic species were potentially further assisted by human-mediated dispersal. 5. Species and functional diversity was inversely related to exotic cover. By shifting the balance between native and exotic taxa and changing community functional composition, flow regulation may disrupt the ecological function and ecosystem services of floodplain wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. Worldwide, flow regulation has led to riverine ecosystems becoming more terrestrial. The success of most introduced plants relies on minimal inundation. In this study, flood magnitude was more important than frequency, timing, or duration for wetland flora because it reflects spatial extent and depth of flooding. Augmenting natural spring floods with environmental flows will kill terrestrial weeds and facilitate native macrophyte growth. Combined with strategies for managing particular amphibious weeds, we recommend flows of 117 000\textendash{}147 000 ML day-1 for at least 2 days every 10 years for River Murray wetland weed management.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the content and composition of soil carbon in the laboratory is time-consuming, requires specialised equipment and is therefore expensive. Rapid, simple and low-cost accurate methods of analysis are required to support current interests in carbon accounting. This study was completed to develop national and state-based models capable of predicting soil carbon content and composition by coupling diffuse reflectance mid-infrared (MIR) spectra with partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses. Total, organic and inorganic carbon contents were determined and MIR spectra acquired for 20 495 soil samples collected from 4526 locations from soil depths to 1 m within Australia's agricultural regions. However, all subsequent MIR/PLSR models were developed using soils only collected from the 0\textendash{}10, 10\textendash{}20 and 20\textendash{}30 cm depth layers. The extent of grinding applied to air-dried soil samples was found to be an important determinant of the variability in acquired MIR spectra. After standardisation of the grinding time, national MIR/PLSR models were developed using an independent test-set validation approach to predict the square-root transformed contents of total, organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen. Laboratory fractionation of soil organic carbon into particulate, humus and resistant forms was completed on 312 soil samples. Reliable national MIR/PLSR models were developed using cross-validation to predict the contents of these soil organic carbon fractions; however, further work is required to enhance the representation of soils with significant contents of inorganic carbon. Regional MIR/PLSR models developed for total, organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen contents were found to produce more reliable and accurate predictions than the national models. The MIR/PLSR approach offers a more rapid and more cost effective method, relative to traditional laboratory methods, to derive estimates of the content and composition of soil carbon and total nitrogen content provided that the soils are well represented by the calibration samples used to build the predictive models.},

  volume = {29},
  issn = {0165-9936},
  abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-IR spectroscopy applied to soil compositional analysis started to develop markedly in the 1990s, taking advantage of earlier advances in instrumentation and chemometrics for agricultural products. Today, NIR spectroscopy is envisioned as replacing laboratory analysis in certain applications (e.g., soil-carbon-credit assessment at the farm level). However, accuracy is still unsatisfactory compared with standard laboratory procedures, leading some authors to think that such a challenge will never be met. This article investigates the critical points to be aware of when accuracy of NIR-based measurements is assessed. First is the decomposition of the standard error of prediction into components of bias and variance, only the latter being reducible by averaging. This decomposition is not used routinely in the soil-science literature. Contrarily, a log-normal distribution of reference values is very often encountered with soil samples [e.g., elemental concentrations (e.g., carbon)] with numerous small or zero values. These very skewed distributions make us take precautions when using inverse regression methods (e.g., principal component regression or partial least squares), which force the predictions towards the centre of the calibration set, leading to negative effects on the standard error prediction \textendash{} and therefore on prediction accuracy \textendash{} especially when log-normal distributions are encountered. Such distributions, which are very common for soil components, also make the ratio of performance to deviation a useless, even hazardous, tool, leading to erroneous conclusions. We propose a new index based on the quartiles of the empirical distribution \textendash{} ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance \textendash{} to overcome this problem.},

  abstract = {This paper is an extensive review of the research that has been undertaken on near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy applied to soil particularly for determining carbon (C) content. The objective is to determine which acquisition method (NIR, MIR, in the field or in the laboratory) might be recommended for the purpose of C stock measurement with a particular interest in carbon credit trading. For this purpose, an optimal method has to satisfy the dual constraints of low-cost and high throughput analysis. The various methods proposed in the literature are compared. In order to make comparisons as reliable as possible, special attention has been paid to the conditions of data acquisition (sample preparation), and to calibration and validation procedures. In particular, whether the validation has been carried out on fully independent samples or on samples similar to the ones of the calibration set greatly influences the results. Also, for C stock measurement, it is absolutely necessary to measure the bias of the prediction in order to be conclusive about the feasibility of the method. However, only few researchers provide this parameter and we recommend including it as a matter of course in future reports. Finally, although MIR on dried and ground samples is the most accurate method, on-the-go and in-field sensors provide predictions accurate enough to show promise in being a valuable component of technologies that would be used for C-credit purposes. But in order to meet the cost/accuracy trade-off, the main issue using such field sensors is to be able to simultaneously measure the bulk density or, better, to directly measure the volumetric concentration of C in soil. This circumvents the costs of field extraction and laboratory analysis. This is the next great challenge to be met by soil scientists.},

  volume = {59},
  issn = {0021-8561},
  abstract = {A nongravimetric acetyl bromide lignin (ABL) method was evaluated to quantify lignin concentration in a variety of plant materials. The traditional approach to lignin quantification required extraction of lignin with acidic dioxane and its isolation from each plant sample to construct a standard curve via spectrophotometric analysis. Lignin concentration was then measured in pre-extracted plant cell walls. However, this presented a methodological complexity because extraction and isolation procedures are lengthy and tedious, particularly if there are many samples involved. This work was targeted to simplify lignin quantification. Our hypothesis was that any lignin, regardless of its botanical origin, could be used to construct a standard curve for the purpose of determining lignin concentration in a variety of plants. To test our hypothesis, lignins were isolated from a range of diverse plants and, along with three commercial lignins, standard curves were built and compared among them. Slopes and intercepts derived from these standard curves were close enough to allow utilization of a mean extinction coefficient in the regression equation to estimate lignin concentration in any plant, independent of its botanical origin. Lignin quantification by use of a common regression equation obviates the steps of lignin extraction, isolation, and standard curve construction, which substantially expedites the ABL method. Acetyl bromide lignin method is a fast, convenient analytical procedure that may routinely be used to quantify lignin.},

  abstract = {Normal mixture models are being increasingly used to model the distributions of a wide variety of random phenomena and to cluster sets of continuous multivariate data. However, for a set of data containing a group or groups of observations with longer than normal tails or atypical observations, the use of normal components may unduly affect the fit of the mixture model. In this paper, we consider a more robust approach by modelling the data by a mixture of t distributions. The use of the ECM algorithm to fit this t mixture model is described and examples of its use are given in the context of clustering multivariate data in the presence of atypical observations in the form of background noise.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) flux from wetland systems, both in their natural state and following drainage, has not been well accounted for in the carbon accounting process. We review GHG production from both natural and drained wetlands, and estimate the likely GHG emissions from these systems in Australia. Only a small number of studies have quantified GHG emissions from undisturbed Australian wetland environments. Consequently, in order to estimate GHG flux for Australia, it was necessary to collate data collected overseas from similar climatic zones. Using this approach, it appears that undisturbed, vegetated wetlands in Australia are likely to be net GHG sinks, with the greatest rates of sequestration occurring in mangrove ecosystems (\textendash{}2669 g CO2-e/m2.year) where biomass production is high but CH4 emissions are limited by salinity. The uncertainty surrounding these values is high, however, due to (a) the low number of measurements from Australia, (b) the low number of measurements for CO2 flux, and (c) the low number of studies where all GHGs have been measured concurrently. It was estimated that the drainage of melaleuca and mangrove forest wetlands in Australia would turn them from carbon sinks into carbon sources, and that in the first 50 years since drainage, this has increased global warming potential by 1149 Tg CO2-e or 23 Tg CO2-e/year. This is significant given that GHG emissions due to land-use change in 2007 totalled 77.1 Tg CO2-e. However, data surrounding the area of wetlands drained, carbon stocks in drained wetlands, and the effect of drainage on CH4 and N2O flux are limited, making the uncertainty surrounding these estimates high. Further study is clearly required if Australia wishes to accurately incorporate wetland systems into national carbon and greenhouse gas accounting budgets.},

  shorttitle = {Soil Organic Carbon Variability in {{Australian}} Temperate Freshwater Wetlands},
  abstract = {Globally, there is little information on freshwater (non-tidal) wetland below ground soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, sequestration rates and, in particular, their within-wetland variation. This basic information is critical for designing programs to sample SOC stocks and identifying areas that sequester large amounts of carbon so that they can be managed to prevent degradation and carbon loss. Here, focusing on temperate seasonally inundated freshwater wetlands in south-eastern Australia, we compared SOC stocks and sequestration rates (via radiometric dating) among wetlands, within wetland locations (High water mark, Edge and Middle), and with adjacent terrestrial locations. SOC stocks varied most among wetlands but also varied inconsistently within wetlands. Wetland SOC stocks (20.4 6 0.1 kg C m22) were significantly greater than adjacent terrestrial locations (13.3 6 0.1 kg C m22). Wetland SOC sequestration rates were similar among all locations (i.e., within a wetland, ranging from 70 g C m22 yr21 to 87 g C m22 yr21). The relative lack of difference in SOC stocks among wetland locations allows for reduced within-wetland sampling and subsequently greater replication at the wetland level, at least for temperate ephemeral freshwater wetlands, although these findings need to be confirmed over a range of wetland types. This study also produced the first estimates of temperate freshwater wetland SOC stocks and sequestration rates in Australia, and is among the first studies globally to demonstrate that seasonally inundated wetlands can sequester carbon at significant rates. It therefore provides important justification to support the protection and rehabilitation of temperate freshwater wetlands worldwide.},

  abstract = {Environmental water allocations are used to improve the ecological health of wetlands. There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha21) than ephemeral reedbeds (116\textendash{}138 Mg ha21). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. 13C enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m22 yr21) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m22 yr21). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.},

Of the three options of reducing the global energy use, developing low or no-carbon fuel and sequestering emissions, this manuscript describes processes for carbon (CO2) sequestration and discusses abiotic and biotic technologies. Carbon sequestration implies transfer of atmospheric CO2 into other long-lived global pools including oceanic, pedologic, biotic and geological strata to reduce the net rate of increase in atmospheric CO2. Engineering techniques of CO2 injection in deep ocean, geological strata, old coal mines and oil wells, and saline aquifers along with mineral carbonation of CO2 constitute abiotic techniques. These techniques have a large potential of thousands of Pg, are expensive, have leakage risks and may be available for routine use by 2025 and beyond. In comparison, biotic techniques are natural and cost-effective processes, have numerous ancillary benefits, are immediately applicable but have finite sink capacity. Biotic and abiotic C sequestration options have specific nitches, are complementary, and have potential to mitigate the climate change risks.},

  abstract = {[Wetland ecosystems have a high carbon storage potential as a result of high primary productivity and low decomposition rates dictated by water saturation. In the herbaceous wetlands of the Paran{\'a} River Delta, drainage and afforestation with poplars represents one of the dominant land uses. We explored the effects of these interventions on the volume and carbon storage of the young sedimentary soils of the region. At three sites we identified paired stands occupying similar landscape positions and soil types but subject to natural flooding and covered by natural herbaceous communities or drainage and flood control by dikes and covered by poplar plantations established 12, 17 and 19 years ago. Soil sampling at these sites revealed a reduction of the litter compartment (\textendash{}86 \%) and decreasing volume and porosity of its underlying mineral layer (0\textendash{}10 cm in the wetland reduced to 0\textendash{}4 cm in the plantation). Our comparisons of carbon storage accounted for these volumetric shifts by using accumulated mineral mass rather than depth as a reference, showing that tree plantations gained in the mineral soil (22 Mg C ha{$^{-1}$}) almost as much as what they lost in the litter. These gains were particularly large at intermediate depths (4\textendash{}43 cm in the plantations) were soil porosity remained unaffected and C was raised by 64 \% explained by (1) the pulse of inputs from overlaying litter and organic layers subject to rapid decomposition and mobilization after drainage and (2) root colonization, since tree plantations had 75 \% of their fine root biomass at these intermediate soil depths, whereas roots in the wetlands did not explore the mineral soil profile and were completely confined to the organic layer. A neutral C balance following wetland drainage and afforestation resulted from the opposing effects of aeration, favoring decomposition in the organic layer, root colonization and organic matter stabilization, favoring its accumulation in the mineral soil.]},

We find that wetlands in the conterminous United States store a total of 11.52 PgC, much of which is within soils deeper than 30 cm.

  abstract = {Palustrine wetlands (PWs) include all bogs, fens, swamps and marshes that are non-saline and which are not lakes or rivers. They therefore form a highly important group of wetlands which hold large carbon stocks. If these wetlands are not protected properly they could become a net carbon source in the future. Compilation of spatially explicit wetland databases, national inventory data and in situ measurement of soil organic carbon (SOC) could be useful to better quantify SOC and formulate long-term strategies for mitigating global climate change. In this study, a synergistic mapping approach was used to create a hybrid map for PWs for China and to estimate their SOC content. Total SOC storage in PWs was estimated to be 4.3 {$\pm$} 1.4 Pg C, with a SOC density of 31.17 ({$\pm$}10.55) kg C m-2 in the upper 1 m of the soil layer. This carbon stock is concentrated in Northeast China (49\%) and the Qinghai\textendash{}Tibet Plateau (41\%). Given the large pool of carbon stored in PWs compared to other soil types, we suggest that urgent monitoring programmes on SOC should be established in regions with very few datasets, but where PWs appear to be common such as the Tibet region and Northwest China.},

Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States.},

INFyS data served as model response for spatially extending the field-based estimates of carbon stored in the aboveground live dry biomass to a wall-to-wall map, with 30 \texttimes{} 30 m2 pixel posting using canopy density estimates derived from Landsat, L-Band radar data from ALOS PALSAR, as well as elevation information derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data set. Validation against an independent set of INFyS plots resulted in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.5 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14 t{$\bullet$}C/ha  in the case of flat terrain. The validation for different forest types showed a consistently low estimation bias (\&lt;3 t{$\bullet$}C/ha) and R2s in the range of 0.5 except for mangroves (R2 = 0.2). Lower accuracies were achieved for forests located on steep slopes (\&gt;15\textdegree{}) with an R2 of 0.34.

  abstract = {Wetlands offer many ecosystem services, including the long-term sequestering of carbon (C) in soil. Here we present a study of C sequestration rates in a relatively undisturbed wetland landscape of southwest Florida. Accordingly, carbon sequestration was determined in four wetland plant communities and an adjacent hydric pine flatwood community that represent a gradient of inundation extent. Going from the wettest to the driest, communities were designated as: deep slough, bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), wet prairie and pond cypress (Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium). An adjacent hydric pine flatwood community was also included in the study as a reference upland site. Three soil cores were collected from each of these communities and were analyzed for total C content. Core samples were also analyzed for 137Cs and 210Pb activity to estimate accretion rates. C sequestration rates (g-C m-2 yr-1) were the highest in the deep slough (98 {$\pm$} 9) and bald cypress (98 {$\pm$} 5) followed by the pond cypress (64 {$\pm$} 7), wet prairie (39 {$\pm$} 1) and pine flatwood (22 {$\pm$} 5). These results suggest that impediment of decomposition by anaerobic conditions caused by prolonged wet cycles, may not account for all the variability in C sequestration rates observed in this subtropical setting. Instead, this variability could also be attributed to other factors like the quantity and chemical composition of the organic material reaching the soil. When methane emissions are taken into account, cypress-dominated (bald and pond cypress) and the deep slough communities act as net carbon sinks.},

  issn = {1939-9170},
  abstract = {Recently there have been major theoretical advances in the quantification and partitioning of diversity within and among communities, regions, and ecosystems. However, applying those advances to real data remains a challenge. Ecologists often end up describing their samples rather than estimating the diversity components of an underlying study system, and existing approaches do not easily provide statistical frameworks for testing ecological questions. Here we offer one avenue to do all of the above using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We estimate posterior distributions of the underlying ``true'' relative abundances of each species within each unit sampled. These posterior estimates of relative abundance can then be used with existing formulae to estimate and partition diversity. The result is a posterior distribution of diversity metrics describing our knowledge (or beliefs) about the study system. This approach intuitively leads to statistical inferences addressing biologically motivated hypotheses via Bayesian model comparison. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our approach does as well or better at approximating the ``true'' diversity of a community relative to na{\"i}ve or ad-hoc bias-corrected estimates. Moreover, model comparison correctly distinguishes between alternative hypotheses about the distribution of diversity within and among samples. Finally, we use an empirical ecological dataset to illustrate how the approach can be used to address questions about the makeup and diversities of assemblages at local and regional scales.},

Analysis of variance is useful if the intent is to compare treatment means, but does not directly test hypotheses regarding decomposition rates.

Samples were hydrolysed with 2.5 m H2SO4 under reflux for 20 min to release non-cellulosic sugars and subsequently with 12 M/0.5 m H2SO4 to release glucose from cellulose-like polymers. Total radioactivity was determined in whole soil and hydrolysates and in individual sugars. Fitting the data to simple exponential equations, total and 2.5 m H2SO4 hydrolysate radioactivity were best expressed by three part exponential functions, whereas radioactivity in 12M/0.5M H2SO4 hydrolysates and sugars were best expressed by two part functions, except for arabinose from the straw, for which a three-part function was better. A comparison of the fit was made with that using the single-term exponential expressions devised by Janssen, 1984 and Weibull, 1951 and with a modification of the two part exponential expression by the substitution of one term by the Weibull expression. Apart from the Weibull expression on its own, there was no significant difference between the expressions. It is suggested that, even for well defined carbohydrate components of the substrate, the decomposability changes with time because of their increasing inaccessibility to microorganisms, rather than that several components are present each with a different constant rate of decomposition.},

Mortality variation across species is thought to be influenced by different factors relative to variation within species. The unified model provided here separates mortality rates into growth-dependent and growth-independent hazards. This model creates the opportunity to simultaneously estimate these hazards both across and within species. Moreover, it provides the ability to examine how species traits affect growth-dependent and growth-independent hazards. We derive this unified mortality model using cross-validated Bayesian methods coupled with mortality data collected over three census intervals for 203 tropical rainforest tree species at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We found that growth-independent mortality tended to be higher in species with lower wood density, higher light requirements, and smaller maximum diameter at breast height (dbh). Mortality due to marginal carbon budget as measured by near-zero growth rate tended to be higher in species with lower wood density and higher light demand. The total mortality variation attributable to differences among species was large relative to variation explained by these traits, emphasizing that much remains to be understood. This additive hazards model strengthens our capacity to parse and understand individual-level mortality in highly diverse tropical forests and hence to predict its consequences.},

  abstract = {[The influence of inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs on decomposition is poorly understood. Some prior studies suggest that N may reduce the decomposition of substrates with high concentrations of lignin via inhibitory effects on the activity of lignin-degrading enzymes, although such inhibition has not always been demonstrated. I studied the effects of N addition on decomposition of seven substrates ranging in initial lignin concentrations (from 7.4\% to 25.6\%) over five years in eight different grassland and forest sites in central Minnesota, USA. I predicted that N would stimulate the decomposition of lignin-poor substrates but retard the decomposition of lignin-rich substrates. Across these sites, N had neutral or negative effects on decomposition rates. However, in contrast to my hypothesis, effects of N on decomposition were independent of substrate initial lignin concentrations, and decomposition of the lignin fraction was unaffected by N fertilization. Rather, substrate\textemdash{}site combinations that exhibited more rapid decomposition rates in the control treatment were affected more negatively by addition of N fertilization. Taken together, these results suggest that decreased decomposition with added N did not result from inhibition of lignin-degrading enzyme activity, but may have resulted from abiotic interactions between N fertilizer and products of microbial degradation or synthesis or from N effects on the decomposer community. Low initial substrate N concentrations and N fertilization both stimulated N immobilization, but the differences among substrates were generally much larger than the effects of fertilization. This study suggests that atmospheric N addition could stimulate ecosystem carbon sequestration in some ecosystems as a result of reduced rates of forest floor decomposition.]},

  abstract = {[I investigated the relationship between leaf physiological traits and decomposition of leaf litter for 35 plant species of contrasting growth forms from a lowland tropical forest in Panama to determine whether leaf traits could be used to predict decomposition. Decomposition rate (k) was correlated with specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) across all species. Photosynthetic rate per unit mass (Amass) was not correlated with k, but structural equation modeling showed support for a causal model with significant indirect effects of Amass on k through SLA, N, and P, but not K. The results indicate that the decomposability of leaf tissue in this tropical forest is related to a global spectrum of leaf economics that varies from thin, easily decomposable leaves with high nutrient concentrations and high photosynthetic rates to thick, relatively recalcitrant leaves with greater physical toughness and defenses and low photosynthetic rates. If this pattern is robust across biomes, then selection for suites of traits that maximize photosynthetic carbon gain over the lifetime of the leaf may be used to predict the effects of plant species on leaf litter decomposition, thus placing the ecosystem process of decomposition in an evolutionary context.]},

  abstract = {The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

There are two difficulties apart from the demonstrability issue itself: (1) multiple regression is plagued by collinear relationships in X; and (2) any regression is designed to produce a function that in some way minimizes the overall difference between the observed and 'predicted' Ys, which does not necessarily equate to determining probable influence in a multivariate setting. Problem (1) may be explored by comparing two avenues, one in which a single 'best' regression model is sought and the other where all possible regression models are considered contemporaneously.

The procedure is nonparametric and can be applied to any automated model building technique. It can also provide important diagnostic information about influential cases in the dataset and the stability of the model. Two experiments were conducted using cross-validation to estimate forecast skill in different predictive models of North Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The results indicate that bias, or artificial predictability (defined here as the difference between the usual hindcast skill and the forecast skill estimated by cross-validation), increases with each decision\textemdash{}either screening of potential predictors or fixing the value of a coefficient\textemdash{}drawn from the data. Bias introduced by variable screening depends on the size of the pool of potential predictors, while bias produced by fitting coefficients depends on the number of coefficients. The results also indicate that winter SSTs are predictable with a skill of about 20\%\textendash{}25\%. Several models were compared. More flexible ones which allow the data to guide the selection of variables generally show poorer skill than the relatively inflexible models where a priori variable selection is used. The cross-validation estimates of artificial skill were compared with estimates derived from other methods. Davis and Chelton's method showed close agreement with the cross-validation results for a priori models. However, Monte Carlo estimates and cross-validation estimates do not agree well in the case of predictor screening models. The results of this study indicate that the amount of artificial skill depends on the amount of true skill, so Monte Carlo techniques which assume no true skill cannot be expected to perform well when there is some true skill.},

  abstract = {Plant species differ in many functional traits that drive differences in rates of photosynthesis, biomass allocation, and tissue turnover. However, it remains unclear how-and even if-such traits influence whole-plant growth, with the simple linear relationships predicted by existing theory often lacking empirical support. Here, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the effect of diverse functional traits on plant growth and shade tolerance by extending a widely used model, linking growth rate in seedlings with a single leaf trait, to explicitly include influences of size, light environment, and five prominent traits: seed mass, height at maturation, leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area, and wood density. Based on biomass growth and allocation, this framework explains why the influence of traits on growth rate and shade tolerance often varies with plant size and why the impact of size on growth varies among traits. Specifically, we demonstrate why for height growth the influence of: (i) leaf mass per unit leaf area is strong in small plants but weakens with size; (ii) leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area does not change with size; (iii) wood density is present across sizes; (iv) height at maturation strengthens with size; and (v) seed mass decreases with size.

  volume = {35},
  issn = {0906-7590},
  abstract = {Quantifying how functional traits relate to environmental gradients provides insight into mechanisms governing species distributions. Here, we bring together the fields of species distribution modelling and functional trait ecology with hierarchical modelling by explicitly incorporating traits into a multi-species distribution model. We combined traits from the leaf-height-seed strategy scheme (specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass) with a distribution model for 20 eucalypt taxa in Victoria, Australia. The key insight of this approach is how traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients. The strongest link was between SLA and percent rock cover (species with low SLA had positive responses to rockiness, whereas high SLA species responded negatively to rockiness). We found evidence for complex yet potentially important interactions. For instance, the probability of species occurrence increased with rainfall and solar radiation on average yet the response varied depending on species height and SLA. Tall species were predicted to increase with rainfall and solar radiation across the range of SLA values (tall species with low SLA were especially sensitive to rainfall). Short species responded positively to rainfall and solar radiation only if they had low SLA. This framework readily accounts for interactions between combinations of traits and environmental variables unlike multi-step approaches. Further application of this concept will contribute to a generalized mechanistic understanding of how traits influence species distributions along environmental gradients, with implications for understanding the response of species to global change.},

  shorttitle = {Wetland Plant Decomposition under Different Nutrient Conditions},
  abstract = {Plants in nutrient poor environments are often characterized by high nutrient resorption resulting in poor litter quality and, consequently, slow decomposition. We used oligotrophic, P-limited herbaceous wetlands of northern Belize as a model system, on which to document and explain how changes in nutrient content along a salinity gradient affect decomposition rates of macrophytes. In 2001 we established a nutrient addition experiment (P, N, and N\&P) in 15 marshes of a wide range of water conductivities (200\textendash{}6000 {$\mu$}S), dominated by Eleocharis spp. To determine what is more important for decomposition, the initial litter quality, or site differences, we used reciprocal litter placement and cellulose decomposition assay in a combined ``site quality'' and ``litter quality'' experiment. Our prediction of the positive effects of P-enrichment on decomposition rate due to both the quality of litter and the site was confirmed. The site effect was stronger than the litter quality although both were highly significant. Strong site quality effect was apparently the result of more active decomposer community in P-enriched plots as supported by finding of higher microbial biomass in litter decomposing there. The strong effect of site quality on decomposition was further confirmed by the cellulose assay. The cellulose decomposition was significantly slower at high salinity sites indicating lower decomposer microbial activity. Litter nutrient N and P content and nutrient ratios were well correlated with decomposition with the best fit found for log C/P. At C/P mass ratio of {$>$}4000 decomposition processes were extremely slow. We hypothesize that in a long run, the increased decomposition will compensate the increase in primary production resulting from increased nutrient loading and there will be no differences in accumulation of organic material between the controls and nutrient enriched plots.},

  abstract = {Carbon sequestration by agricultural soils has been widely promoted as a means of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In many regions agricultural fields are just one component of a complex landscape matrix and understanding the interactions between agricultural fields and other landscape components such as wetlands is crucial for comprehensive, whole-landscape accounting of soil organic carbon (SOC) change. Our objective was to assess the effects of management and erosional history on SOC storage in wetlands of a typical hummocky agricultural landscape in southern Saskatchewan. Wetlands were classed into three land management groups: native wetlands (i.e., within a native landscape), and uncultivated and cultivated wetlands within an agricultural landscape. Detailed topographic surveys were used to develop a digital elevation model of the sites and landform segmentation algorithms were used to delineate the topographic data into landform elements. SOC density to 45 cm was assessed at seven uncultivated wetlands, seven cultivated wetlands, and twelve native wetlands. Mean SOC density decreased from 175.1 mg ha-1 to 30 cm (equivalent mass depth) for the native wetlands to 168.6 mg ha-1 for the uncultivated wetlands and 87.2 mg ha-1 for the cultivated wetlands in the agricultural field. The SOC density of sediment depositional fans in the uncultivated wetlands is high but the total SOC stored in the fans is low due to their small area. The uncultivated wetlands occupy only 11\% of the site but account for approximately 23\% of SOC stores. Re-establishing permanent vegetation in the cultivated wetlands could provide maximum C sequestration with minimum energy inputs and a minimum loss of productive acreage but the overall consequences for the gas emissions would have to be carefully assessed.},

  shorttitle = {Increasing Soil Carbon Storage},
  abstract = {The international 4 per 1000 initiative aims at supporting states and non-governmental stakeholders in their efforts towards a better management of soil carbon (C) stocks. These stocks depend on soil C inputs and outputs. They are the result of fine spatial scale interconnected mechanisms, which stabilise/destabilise organic matter-borne C. Since 2016, the CarboSMS consortium federates French researchers working on these mechanisms and their effects on C stocks in a local and global change setting (land use, agricultural practices, climatic and soil conditions, etc.). This article is a synthesis of this consortium's first seminar. In the first part, we present recent advances in the understanding of soil C stabilisation mechanisms comprising biotic and abiotic processes, which occur concomitantly and interact. Soil organic C stocks are altered by biotic activities of plants (the main source of C through litter and root systems), microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) and `ecosystem engineers' (earthworms, termites, ants). In the meantime, abiotic processes related to the soil-physical structure, porosity and mineral fraction also modify these stocks. In the second part, we show how agricultural practices affect soil C stocks. By acting on both biotic and abiotic mechanisms, land use and management practices (choice of plant species and density, plant residue exports, amendments, fertilisation, tillage, etc.) drive soil spatiotemporal organic inputs and organic matter sensitivity to mineralisation. Interaction between the different mechanisms and their effects on C stocks are revealed by meta-analyses and long-term field studies. The third part addresses upscaling issues. This is a cause for major concern since soil organic C stabilisation mechanisms are most often studied at fine spatial scales (mm\textendash{$\mu$}m) under controlled conditions, while agricultural practices are implemented at the plot scale. We discuss some proxies and models describing specific mechanisms and their action in different soil and climatic contexts and show how they should be taken into account in large scale models, to improve change predictions in soil C stocks. Finally, this literature review highlights some future research prospects geared towards preserving or even increasing C stocks, our focus being put on the mechanisms, the effects of agricultural practices on them and C stock prediction models.},

Total SOC stocks among wetlands ranged from 123.30 to 291.29 Mg C ha-1. These differences indicate the spatial variability of SOC within wetland locations and among wetlands.

Models, such as Jenkinson's or Parton's Century model, help to define soil organic matter fractions of different functions, based on residence time/14C age. Rejuvenation of soil carbon was felt to be the principal impediment to absolute soil dating, in addition to the ambiguity of the initiation point of soil formation and soil age. Recent studies, for example, of Becker-Heidmann (1989), indicate that a soil 14C age of {$>$}1000 yr cannot have {$>$}0.1\% rejuvenation in the total soil organic matter compartments/fractions to be possible and sustainable. Always problematic in earlier observations were age vs. depth increases, in 14C profile curves showing an inflection of reduced age in the deepest samples, i.e., from the rim of the organic matter containing epipedon. We attribute this phenomenon, in mollic horizons, to earthworm casts in the terminal part of the escape tube. Becker-Heidmann (1989) has shown, in thin layer soil profile dating, a highly significant correlation between the highest 14C ages and the highest clay content. Thus, optimization of soil dating is, to a lesser degree, related to the applied extracting solvent system than to soil texture fractions. Such observations allow us to mitigate error ranges inherent in dating dynamic soil systems.},

  issn = {1939-5582},
  abstract = {As the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on {$>$}2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33\%, 42\%, and 50\% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77\% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56\% and 43\%, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29\% in cold arid shrublands to 57\% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, intermediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests (P {$<$} 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the top 3 m of soil was 2344 Pg C, or 56\% more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500\textendash{}1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1\textendash{}3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.},

One of the objectives of the study is to examine the association of SOC content with climate and to estimate SOC storage in land-cover types at different soil depths.

Some upland land uses have had documented negative effects on soil carbon (C) stocks, although the specific impacts of these disturbances on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in depositional environments are poorly understood. Assessment of SOC stocks in floodplain environments will allow for more precise estimates of C distribution at watershed and regional scales. In this study, we measured SOC pools to depths of 100 and 200 cm in four distinct floodplain landscapes (natural levee, flats, mineral wetlands, organic wetlands) in a large bottomland forest within Congaree National Park, South Carolina, USA. Mean SOC stocks to a depth of 100 cm were 108\textendash{}109 Mg C ha-1 in flats and levees, 193 Mg C ha-1 in mineral wetlands, and 533 Mg C ha-1 in organic wetlands. In addition, hydric soils contained significantly more SOC in deep horizons (100\textendash{}200 cm depths). At a regional scale, similar alluvial soils within large floodplains were estimated to store approximately 0.l Pg of SOC. These results highlight the importance of inclusion of deep SOC storage in alluvial settings when estimating watershed C budgets.},

These factors are discussed within the framework of current soil organic matter models. The importance of soil structure in the stabilisation of organic residues through physical protection has been documented previously in various studies. In addition, changes in soil structure associated with tillage can significantly affect soil organic matter decomposition rates. The concept of physical protection has been incorporated into several soil carbon models as a function of soil texture. While soil texture can affect the soil's capacity for aggregation and adsorption, factors such as soil moisture and temperature may further enhance or reduce the extent of physical protection. While adsorption and aggregation can slow decomposition processes, it is unlikely that these processes are solely responsible for the high mean residence times measured in biologically active surface soils. Accordingly, chemical recalcitrance appears to be the only mechanism by which soil organic carbon can be protected for long periods of time.},

Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are becoming increasingly interested in studying the phylogenetic signal and the processes which drive patterns of trait values in the phylogeny. Here, we present a new R package, phylosignal which provides a collection of tools to explore the phylogenetic signal for continuous biological traits. These tools are mainly based on the concept of autocorrelation and have been first developed in the field of spatial statistics. To illustrate the use of the package, we analyze the phylogenetic signal in pollution sensitivity for 17 species of diatoms.},

  abstract = {Premise of the Study Large phylogenies can help shed light on macroevolutionary patterns that inform our understanding of fundamental processes that shape the tree of life. These phylogenies also serve as tools that facilitate other systematic, evolutionary, and ecological analyses. Here we combine genetic data from public repositories (GenBank) with phylogenetic data (Open Tree of Life project) to construct a dated phylogeny for seed plants. Methods We conducted a hierarchical clustering analysis of publicly available molecular data for major clades within the Spermatophyta. We constructed phylogenies of major clades, estimated divergence times, and incorporated data from the Open Tree of Life project, resulting in a seed plant phylogeny. We estimated diversification rates, excluding those taxa without molecular data. We also summarized topological uncertainty and data overlap for each major clade. Key Results The trees constructed for Spermatophyta consisted of 79,881 and 353,185 terminal taxa; the latter included the Open Tree of Life taxa for which we could not include molecular data from GenBank. The diversification analyses demonstrated nested patterns of rate shifts throughout the phylogeny. Data overlap and inference uncertainty show significant variation throughout and demonstrate the continued need for data collection across seed plants. Conclusions This study demonstrates a means for combining available resources to construct a dated phylogeny for plants. However, this approach is an early step and more developments are needed to add data, better incorporating underlying uncertainty, and improve resolution. The methods discussed here can also be applied to other major clades in the tree of life.},

  volume = {56},
  issn = {1063-5157},
  abstract = {Most phylogenetically based statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative or continuously varying phenotypic traits assume that variation within species is absent or at least negligible, which is unrealistic for many traits. Within-species variation has several components. Differences among populations of the same species may represent either phylogenetic divergence or direct effects of environmental factors that differ among populations (phenotypic plasticity). Within-population variation also contributes to within-species variation and includes sampling variation, instrument-related error, low repeatability caused by fluctuations in behavioral or physiological state, variation related to age, sex, season, or time of day, and individual variation within such categories. Here we develop techniques for analyzing phylogenetically correlated data to include within-species variation, or "measurement error" as it is often termed in the statistical literature. We derive methods for (i) univariate analyses, including measurement of "phylogenetic signal," (ii) correlation and principal components analysis for multiple traits, (iii) multiple regression, and (iv) inference of "functional relations," such as reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The methods are capable of incorporating measurement error that differs for each data point (mean value for a species or population), but they can be modified for special cases in which less is known about measurement error (e.g., when one is willing to assume something about the ratio of measurement error in two traits). We show that failure to incorporate measurement error can lead to both biased and imprecise (unduly uncertain) parameter estimates. Even previous methods that are thought to account for measurement error, such as conventional RMA regression, can be improved by explicitly incorporating measurement error and phylogenetic correlation. We illustrate these methods with examples and simulations and provide Matlab programs.},

Despite centuries of interest, the contributions of different evolutionary lineages to modern-day functional diversity remain poorly quantified. Expanding data bases of plant traits plus rapidly improving phylogenies enable for the first time a data-driven global picture of plant functional diversity across the major clades of higher plants. We mapped five key traits relevant to metabolism, resource competition and reproductive strategy onto a phylogeny across 48324 vascular plant species world-wide, along with climate and biogeographic data. Using a novel metric, we test whether major plant lineages are functionally distinctive. We then highlight the trait\textendash{}lineage combinations that are most functionally distinctive within the present-day spread of ecological strategies. For some trait\textendash{}clade combinations, knowing the clade of a species conveys little information to neo- and palaeo-ecologists. In other trait\textendash{}clade combinations, the clade identity can be highly revealing, especially informative clade\textendash{}trait combinations include Proteaceae, which is highly distinctive, representing the global slow extreme of the leaf economic spectrum.

  volume = {283},
  abstract = {Why are some traits and trait combinations exceptionally common across the tree of life, whereas others are vanishingly rare? The distribution of trait diversity across a clade at any time depends on the ancestral state of the clade, the rate at which new phenotypes evolve, the differences in speciation and extinction rates across lineages, and whether an equilibrium has been reached. Here we examine the role of transition rates, differential diversification (speciation minus extinction) and non-equilibrium dynamics on the evolutionary history of angiosperms, a clade well known for the abundance of some trait combinations and the rarity of others. Our analysis reveals that three character states (corolla present, bilateral symmetry, reduced stamen number) act synergistically as a key innovation, doubling diversification rates for lineages in which this combination occurs. However, this combination is currently less common than predicted at equilibrium because the individual characters evolve infrequently. Simulations suggest that angiosperms will remain far from the equilibrium frequencies of character states well into the future. Such non-equilibrium dynamics may be common when major innovations evolve rarely, allowing lineages with ancestral forms to persist, and even outnumber those with diversification-enhancing states, for tens of millions of years.},

  abstract = {Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody species restricted to warm habitats1,2,3. This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with manifold growth forms4. As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits (that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to freezing). To model the evolution of species' traits and climate occupancies, we combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223 species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe conduits5 and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered labile6, but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy. Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aim Biodiversity is declining rapidly at a global scale, fuelling the need for urgent conservation action. With limited resources available, areas for conservation often need to be prioritized. Phylo-diversity metrics such as phylogenetic diversity (PD) and phylogenetic endemism (PE) combine phylogenies and spatial distribution data and can be used to rank candidate areas for conservation. Phylogenetic trees underlying phylo-diversity metrics are available in two main forms, phylograms and chronograms. We examined the use of these two types of phylogenies in spatial studies and tested whether there is a difference in the resultant hotspot localities when employing either for analysing the same dataset. Location Australia and New Zealand. Methods We reanalysed three published datasets and one new dataset of geocoded species presence data and DNA sequence data. In all cases, we inferred first a phylogram and then time-calibrated it to keep tree topology constant. We conducted spatial analyses with equal area grid cells and compared the distribution of PD and PE hotspots (top 5\% values) as well as Categorical Analysis of Neo- and Palaeo-Endemism between phylogram and chronogram. Results We found that both types of trees were frequently used in spatial studies but that there is no explicit discussion in the relevant community about either choice. Differences in the locations of hotspots between phylogram and chronogram ranged from 11\% to 91\%, with no clear correlation between tree shape and effect size. Main conclusions We demonstrate for the first time that in some cases the choice between phylogram and chronogram can have a dramatic effect on the resulting hotspot distributions. Branch lengths of phylograms indicate divergence in features (or at least in those used to infer the phylogeny), while those of chronograms indicate time since divergence. The interpretation of the resulting phylo-diversity hotspots should reflect this difference.},

  abstract = {The emergence of azole resistance in the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus has continued to increase, with the dominant resistance mechanisms, consisting of a 34-nucleotide tandem repeat (TR34)/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A, now showing a structured global distribution. Using hierarchical clustering and multivariate analysis of 4,049 A. fumigatus isolates collected worldwide and genotyped at nine microsatellite loci using analysis of short tandem repeats of A. fumigatus (STRAf), we show that A. fumigatus can be subdivided into two broad clades and that cyp51A alleles TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A are unevenly distributed across these two populations. Diversity indices show that azole-resistant isolates are genetically depauperate compared to their wild-type counterparts, compatible with selective sweeps accompanying the selection of beneficial mutations. Strikingly, we found that azole-resistant clones with identical microsatellite profiles were globally distributed and sourced from both clinical and environmental locations, confirming that azole resistance is an international public health concern. Our work provides a framework for the analysis of A. fumigatus isolates based on their microsatellite profile, which we have incorporated into a freely available, user-friendly R Shiny application (AfumID) that provides clinicians and researchers with a method for the fast, automated characterization of A. fumigatus genetic relatedness. Our study highlights the effect that azole drug resistance is having on the genetic diversity of A. fumigatus and emphasizes its global importance upon this medically important pathogenic fungus.
IMPORTANCE Azole drug resistance in the human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus continues to emerge, potentially leading to untreatable aspergillosis in immunosuppressed hosts. Two dominant, environmentally associated resistance mechanisms, which are thought to have evolved through selection by the agricultural application of azole fungicides, are now distributed globally. Understanding the effect that azole resistance is having on the genetic diversity and global population of A. fumigatus will help mitigate drug-resistant aspergillosis and maintain the azole class of fungicides for future use in both medicine and crop protection.},

We quantify within-genus differences in biochemical composition to make inferences about decay rates, related to hummock\textendash{}hollow and fen\textendash{}bog gradients and to phylogeny.MethodsWe sampled litter from 15 Sphagnum species, abundant over the whole northern hemisphere. We used regression and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to evaluate general relationships between litter quality parameters and decay rates measured under laboratory and field conditions.ResultsBoth concentrations of the polysaccharide sphagnan and the soluble phenolics were positively correlated with intrinsic decay resistance, however, so were the previously understudied lignin-like phenolics. More resistant litter had more of all the important metabolites; consequently, PC1 scores were related to lab mass loss (R2 = 0.57). There was no such relationship with field mass loss, which is also affected by the environment. PCA also revealed that metabolites clearly group Sphagnum sections (subgenera).ConclusionsWe suggest that the commonly stated growth-decomposition trade-off is largely due to litter quality. We show a strong phylogenetic control on Sphagnum metabolites, but their effects on decay are affected by nutrient availability in the habitat.},

The results showed that thermal decomposition process of peat could be divided into three stages: dehydration, oxidative pyrolysis of organic matters into volatiles and char, and oxidation of the generated char. The apparent activation energies of peat decomposition under different oxygen concentrations were calculated by model-free methods of Kissinger, FWO, Starink, Gyulai, and Friedman. A two-step reaction model was proposed to describe thermal decomposition kinetics of peat (excluding dehydration stage) and the effect of oxygen concentration on the kinetic parameters was discussed.

Recent studies on these cells suggest that cytoskeletal and ultrastructural processes involved in cell differentiation and secondary wall formation are similar in bryophytes and vascular plant tracheary elements. To examine differences in wall structure, primary and secondary wall constituents of the hyaline cells of Sphagnum novo-zelandicum and elaters of the liverwort Radula buccinifera and the hornwort Megaceros gracilis were analyzed by immunohistochemical and chemical methods. Anti-arabinogalactan\textendash{}protein antibodies, JIM8 and JIM13, labeled the central fibrillar secondary wall layer of Megaceros elaters and the walls of Sphagnum leaf cells, but did not label the walls of Radula elaters. The CCRC-M7 antibody, which detects an arabinosylated (1\textrightarrow6)-linked {$\beta$}-galactan epitope, exclusively labeled hyaline cells in Sphagnum leaves and the secondary walls of Radula elaters. Anti-pectin antibodies, LM5 and JIM5, labeled the primary wall in Megaceros elaters. LM5 also labeled the central layer of the secondary wall but only during formation. In Radula elaters, JIM5 and another anti-pectin antibody, JIM7, labeled the primary wall. The distribution of arabinogalactan\textendash{}proteins and pectic polysaccharides restricted to specific wall types and stages of development provides evidence for the developmental and functional regulation of cell wall composition in bryophytes. Monosaccharide-linkage analysis of Sphagnum leaf cell walls suggests they contain polysaccharides similar to those of higher plants. The most abundant linkage was 4-Glc, typical of cellulose, but there was also evidence for xyloglucans, 4-linked mannans, 4-linked xylans and rhamnogalacturonan-type polysaccharides.},

The polymers containing amino groups such as poly(p-aminophenol) and polyphenylenediamines were also shown to possess high thermal stabilities. The activation energies for the thermal degradation of the polymers determined by derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) using Horowitz-Metzger's pseudo-first-order kinetics were in the range between 23-65 kJ/mol and comparable to those of the chemically synthesized polymers. Dynamic structural changes of the enzymatically synthesized polymers upon heating were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC curves of poly(p-phenylphenol) showed a broad exothermic peaks between 150-250 \textdegree{}C, indicating that the polymer undergoes complex structural transitions in the temperature range. On the other hand, the DSC curves of the poly(p-aminophenol) and the poly(p-phenylenediamine) which contain amino groups showed strong sharp endothermic peaks near 150 \textdegree{}C, implying that these polymers possess homogeneous oriented structures which undergo a concerted structural disintegration upon heating.},

  title = {Are Plant Growth-Form-Based Classifications Useful in Predicting Northern Ecosystem Carbon Cycling Feedbacks to Climate Change?},
  volume = {95},
  issn = {1365-2745},
  abstract = {1 Plant species affect ecosystem carbon uptake via biomass production and carbon release via decomposition processes. Differences in their responses to climate change and effects on ecosystem carbon cycling processes may thus feedback to the atmospheric carbon balance and the climate at a global scale. Hierarchical species classifications based on plant growth forms are widely used in cold, northern biomes to generalize and predict these differences. This review investigates the usefulness of broad (vascular, non-vascular), intermediate (woody, non-woody) and narrow (evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, graminoids, forbs) plant growth-form-based groups in these biomes for predicting plant responses to climate change and effects on the main processes of the full carbon cycle by looking at the similarity of species within growth-form groups and the consistency of differences among groups under changing environmental conditions. 2 Production responses to climate change differ between broad growth-form groups, but their opposite responses do not imply that the responses of non-vascular plants are consistently negative. Within vascular growth forms, production responses to climate change are not always similar among species under identical conditions, and average differences among narrow vascular growth forms are usually small. Moreover, differences in production responses among growth forms strongly depend upon the duration of the study, the region and the ecosystem type. 3 Species within narrow growth forms show a high similarity for a range of leaf litter chemistry variables and differences among narrow growth forms are often large and consistent. However, differences in leaf litter decomposability are large between broad growth-form groups, but small and environment-dependent among important narrow vascular growth forms. Litter feedback effects to plant production vary among narrow vascular growth forms, but the differences strongly depend on the study duration. Data on the climate dependence of growth-form differences regarding this aspect of the carbon cycle are currently lacking. 4 Synthesis: Overall, the usefulness of growth-form-based groups clearly differs between carbon cycling processes. Different aggregation levels are therefore needed for different processes. For most processes there is evidence that the differences among growth forms depend on environmental conditions, which hampers their use for generalizations and modelling. Future studies should therefore explicitly test for differences among growth-form groups and aim to unravel the dependence of growth-form differences on environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Evidence shows that bacteria contribute actively to the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose in forest soil; however, their role in this process is still unclear. Here we performed the screening and identification of bacteria showing potential cellulolytic activity from litter and organic soil of a temperate oak forest. The genomes of three cellulolytic isolates previously described as abundant in this ecosystem were sequenced and their proteomes were characterized during the growth on plant biomass and on microcrystalline cellulose. Pedobacter and Mucilaginibacter showed complex enzymatic systems containing highly diverse carbohydrate-active enzymes for the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose, which were functionally redundant for endoglucanases, {$\beta$}-glucosidases, endoxylanases, {$\beta$}-xylosidases, mannosidases and carbohydrate-binding modules. Luteibacter did not express any glycosyl hydrolases traditionally recognized as cellulases. Instead, cellulose decomposition was likely performed by an expressed GH23 family protein containing a cellulose-binding domain. Interestingly, the presence of plant lignocellulose as well as crystalline cellulose both trigger the production of a wide set of hydrolytic proteins including cellulases, hemicellulases and other glycosyl hydrolases. Our findings highlight the extensive and unexplored structural diversity of enzymatic systems in cellulolytic soil bacteria and indicate the roles of multiple abundant bacterial taxa in the decomposition of cellulose and other plant polysaccharides.},

We more clearly quantify these controls with a revised version of the Guild-based Decomposition Model (GDM) in which we used a reverse Michaelis-Menten approach to simulate short-term (112 days) decomposition of roots from four genotypes of Zea mays that differed primarily in lignin chemistry. A co-metabolic relationship between the degradation of lignin and holocellulose (cellulose+hemicellulose) fractions of litter showed that the reduction in decay rate with increasing lignin concentration (LCI) was related to the level of arabinan substitutions in arabinoxylan chains (i.e., arabinan to xylan or A{$:$}X ratio) and the extent to which hemicellulose chains are cross-linked with lignin in plant cell walls. This pattern was consistent between genotypes and during progressive decomposition within each genotype. Moreover, decay rates were controlled by these cross-linkages from the start of decomposition. We also discovered it necessary to divide the Van Soest soluble (labile) fraction of litter C into two pools: one that rapidly decomposed and a second that was more persistent. Simulated microbial production was consistent with recent studies suggesting that more rapidly decomposing materials can generate greater amounts of potentially recalcitrant microbial products despite the rapid loss of litter mass. Sensitivity analyses failed to identify any model parameter that consistently explained a large proportion of model variation, suggesting that feedback controls between litter quality and microbial activity in the reverse Michaelis-Menten approach resulted in stable model behavior. Model extrapolations to an independent set of data, derived from the decomposition of 12 different genotypes of maize roots, averaged within {$<$}3\% of observed respiration rates and total CO2 efflux over 112 days.},

  abstract = {The decomposition of particulate organic matter (POM) from five species of freshwater vascular macrophytes was analyzed over a 180-day period under controlled conditions of temperature and oxygen (10 and 25\textdegree{}C; aerobic and anaerobic). In addition, a series of seasonal decomposition experiments were conducted in situ under different lake conditions. Plant species studied included the emergent Scirpus acutus Bigelow, the floating-leaved lily Nuphar variegatum Engelm., and the submersed Myriophyllum heterophyllum Michx., Najas flexilis (Willd.) Rostk. \& Schmidt, and the submersed bulrush Scirpus subterminalis Torrey. At 2, 4, 10, 24, 48, 90, and 180-day intervals, organic weight, ash, carbon, nitrogen, total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), and fiber components (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose) were determined under each of the experimental conditions. A model was developed that fit the observed weight-loss data, which demonstrated that decay-rate coefficients decreased exponentially with time in response to increasing resistance to decomposition of residual organic constituents. The fastest decomposing species, Nuphar, exhibited losses from 60 (cold, anaerobic) to 90\% (warm, aerobic) over a 180-day period; the slowest, Scirpus acutus, lost only 20 and 40\% under comparable conditions. TNC content decreased more rapidly under warm aerobic than under cold anaerobic conditions. Reduction of TNC was greatest in Nuphar, less in Myriophyllum and Najas, and lowest in the two Scirpus species. Structural carbohydrates decreased slowly among all species with the lignin fraction being the most resistant to degradation. However, decay rates of the macrophytes were negatively correlated to total fiber content rather than to individual fiber components (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin). Floating-leaved plants contained the least amount of structural tissue and decayed most rapidly, followed by submersed and then emergent species. Scirpus subterminalis, although submersed, retains the structural characteristics of the emergent species of this genus and decayed in much the same way as S. acutus. The C:N ratios of tissue of Scirpus acutus were higher than for other species and continuously declined during decomposition under warm, aerobic conditions. In this species, the C:N ratios decreased very slowly under cold, anaerobic conditions. The C:N ratios of the other species were constant after initial rapid declines. Among all species, the proportion of nitrogen in the dissolved organic and inorganic matter of the media decreased rapidly to low levels during decomposition at both low and high temperatures under anaerobic conditions; reductions were less when oxygen was available and decreased least in cultures of the two Scirpus species. Thus, resistance of particulate tissue to microbial decomposition was strongly influenced by the composition of the plant species. The floating-leaved plant decomposed faster than the submersed plants, which decomposed more rapidly than the emergent species. Decay rates were related to initial nitrogen and fiber contents, with high-nitrogen, low-fiber plants decomposing most rapidly. Unlike the leached dissolved organic matter (DOM) of the plants whose rate of decomposition was found to be mostly influenced by oxygen availability, the rate of conversion of particulate matter to carbon dioxide and/or DOM was regulated primarily by temperature, tissue nitrogen, and fiber content. All species showed similar trends in decomposition under both laboratory and in situ conditions, but the species-specific rates differed under the various laboratory conditions of temperature and oxygen.},

  abstract = {We studied soil decomposition in a Panicum hemitomon (Schultes)-dominated freshwater marsh located in southeastern Louisiana that was unambiguously changed by secondarily-treated municipal wastewater effluent. We used four approaches to evaluate how belowground biomass decomposition rates vary under different nutrient regimes in this marsh. The results of laboratory experiments demonstrated how nutrient enrichment enhanced the loss of soil or plant organic matter by 50\%, and increased gas production. An experiment demonstrated that nitrogen, not phosphorus, limited decomposition. Cellulose decomposition at the field site was higher in the flowfield of the introduced secondarily treated sewage water, and the quality of the substrate (\% N or \% P) was directly related to the decomposition rates. We therefore rejected the null hypothesis that nutrient enrichment had no effect on the decomposition rates of these organic soils. In response to nutrient enrichment, plants respond through biomechanical or structural adaptations that alter the labile characteristics of plant tissue. These adaptations eventually change litter type and quality (where the marsh survives) as the \% N content of plant tissue rises and is followed by even higher decomposition rates of the litter produced, creating a positive feedback loop. Marsh fragmentation will increase as a result. The assumptions and conditions underlying the use of unconstrained wastewater flow within natural wetlands, rather than controlled treatment within the confines of constructed wetlands, are revealed in the loss of previously sequestered carbon, habitat, public use, and other societal benefits.},

Here, we used an 18-month reciprocal transplant experiment along a climate gradient in Southern California to disentangle the effects of the microbial community versus the environment on decomposition. Specifically, we tested whether the decomposition response to climate change depends on the microbial community. We inoculated microbial decomposers from each site onto a common, irradiated leaf litter within ``microbial cages'' that prevent microbial exchange with the environment. We characterized fungal and bacterial composition and abundance over time and investigated the functional consequences through litter mass loss and chemistry. After 12 months, microbial communities altered both decomposition rate and litter chemistry. Further, the functional measurements depended on an interaction between the community and its climate in a manner not predicted by current theory. Moreover, microbial ecologists have traditionally considered fungi to be the primary agents of decomposition and for bacteria to play a minor role. Our results indicate that not only does climate change and transplantation have differential legacy effects among bacteria and fungi, but also that bacterial communities might be less functionally redundant than fungi with regards to decomposition. Thus, it may be time to reevaluate both the role of microbial community composition in its decomposition response to climate and the relative roles of bacterial and fungal communities in decomposition.},

  abstract = {The increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 by 31\% since 1750 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change necessitates identification of strategies for mitigating the threat of the attendant global warming. Since the industrial revolution, global emissions of carbon (C) are estimated at 270{$\pm$}30 Pg (Pg=petagram=1015 g=1 billion ton) due to fossil fuel combustion and 136{$\pm$}55 Pg due to land use change and soil cultivation. Emissions due to land use change include those by deforestation, biomass burning, conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, drainage of wetlands and soil cultivation. Depletion of soil organic C (SOC) pool have contributed 78{$\pm$}12 Pg of C to the atmosphere. Some cultivated soils have lost one-half to two-thirds of the original SOC pool with a cumulative loss of 30\textendash{}40 Mg C/ha (Mg=megagram=106 g=1 ton). The depletion of soil C is accentuated by soil degradation and exacerbated by land misuse and soil mismanagement. Thus, adoption of a restorative land use and recommended management practices (RMPs) on agricultural soils can reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 while having positive impacts on food security, agro-industries, water quality and the environment. A considerable part of the depleted SOC pool can be restored through conversion of marginal lands into restorative land uses, adoption of conservation tillage with cover crops and crop residue mulch, nutrient cycling including the use of compost and manure, and other systems of sustainable management of soil and water resources. Measured rates of soil C sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 50 to 1000 kg/ha/year. The global potential of SOC sequestration through these practices is 0.9{$\pm$}0.3 Pg C/year, which may offset one-fourth to one-third of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 estimated at 3.3 Pg C/year. The cumulative potential of soil C sequestration over 25\textendash{}50 years is 30\textendash{}60 Pg. The soil C sequestration is a truly win\textendash{}win strategy. It restores degraded soils, enhances biomass production, purifies surface and ground waters, and reduces the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 by offsetting emissions due to fossil fuel.},

  volume = {140},
  issn = {0034-4257},
  abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is of primary importance in understanding global environment change, urban climatology, and land\textendash{}atmosphere energy exchange. Analysis of long-term remotely sensed LST data remains a challenge for researchers. Most previous studies explored urban thermal pattern over space and time using a limited number of clear-sky images or by removing cloud-contaminated pixels. The limitation in the number of image scenes prevents from deriving long-term LST climatology for a particular region. Moreover, simply eliminating cloudy pixels inevitably obscures the spatial and temporal patterns of LST. This research attempts to characterize the annual and seasonal temperature behaviors during the period of year 2000 to year 2010 in Los Angeles by employing an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model. All 115 image scenes (path 41, row 36) of less than 30\% of cloud cover available from the Landsat archive were utilized for the analysis. Three ATC parameters, i.e., mean annual surface temperature (MAST), yearly amplitude surface temperature (YAST), and the phase shift, were optimized with the Levenberg\textendash{}Marquardt minimization scheme to understand the annual and seasonal characteristics of LST. The overall RMSE of 7.36K was achieved for the optimization for all 115 images; while for the median monthly composite, the RMSE reached 2.85K. The monthly median composite partly removed day-specific anomalies and the impact of cloud cover and reflected LSTs largely under clear sky conditions, leading to the improvement in the modeling result. The MAST and YAST derived from the modeling result of the monthly median composite data were further analyzed to relate to three normalized indices, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The results showed that the mean temperature of urban areas in LA was as high as in the barren land area, reaching almost 310K, but the urban areas possessed a less fluctuation. Seasonal analysis suggested that in winter, the urban areas observed a higher temperature than the barren land/desert, implying that urban materials held a larger amount of heat for a longer time than the barren land. The separation of cloudy scenes into cloud percentage groups made it possible for the evaluation of the effect of cloud cover on the ATC modeling process. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the inclusion of cloudy images brought about a decrease in MAST ranging from 0.18 to 2.0K, depending on the percentage of cloud cover and the number of cloudy scenes used for the modeling. The decrease is due likely to the inclusion of cloud temperatures in analysis rather than shaded or other land surface temperatures. When all cloudy images were included in the modeling, a decrease of 2K in MAST and an increase of 0.15 in YAST were observed. The regression analysis demonstrated that NDBI and NDVI were the main factors influencing the spatial variations of MAST and YAST with the R2 value of 0.63 and 0.49, respectively. In addition, the spatial variation of YAST was found more complex than that of MAST, since the three indices can only explain up to 53\% of its variance.},

  volume = {11},
  issn = {1866-3508},
  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Many maps of open water and wetlands have been developed based on three main methods: (i) compiling national and regional wetland surveys, (ii) identifying inundated areas via satellite imagery and (iii) delineating wetlands as shallow water table areas based on groundwater modeling. However, the resulting global wetland extents vary from 3\&thinsp;\% to 21\&thinsp;\% of the land surface area because of inconsistencies in wetland definitions and limitations in observation or modeling systems. To reconcile these differences, we propose composite wetland (CW) maps, combining two classes of wetlands: (1) regularly flooded wetlands (RFWs) obtained by overlapping selected open-water and inundation datasets; and (2) groundwater-driven wetlands (GDWs) derived from groundwater modeling (either direct or simplified using several variants of the topographic index). Wetlands are statically defined as areas with persistent near-saturated soil surfaces because of regular flooding or shallow groundwater, disregarding most human alterations (potential wetlands). Seven CW maps were generated at 15\&thinsp;arcsec resolution (ca. 500\&thinsp;m at the Equator) using geographic information system (GIS) tools and by combining one RFW and different GDW maps. To validate this approach, these CW maps were compared with existing wetland datasets at the global and regional scales. The spatial patterns were decently captured, but the wetland extents were difficult to assess compared to the dispersion of the validation datasets. Compared with the only regional dataset encompassing both GDWs and RFWs, over France, the CW maps performed well and better than all other considered global wetland datasets. Two CW maps, showing the best overall match with the available evaluation datasets, were eventually selected. These maps provided global wetland extents of 27.5 and 29\&thinsp;million\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{2}, i.e., 21.1\&thinsp;\% and 21.6\&thinsp;\% of the global land area, which are among the highest values in the literature and are in line with recent estimates also recognizing the contribution of GDWs. This wetland class covers 15\&thinsp;\% of the global land area compared with 9.7\&thinsp;\% for RFW (with an overlap of ca. 3.4\&thinsp;\%), including wetlands under canopy and/or cloud cover, leading to high wetland densities in the tropics and small scattered wetlands that cover less than 5\&thinsp;\% of land but are highly important for hydrological and ecological functioning in temperate to arid areas. By distinguishing the RFWs and GDWs based globally on uniform principles, the proposed dataset might be useful for large-scale land surface modeling (hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical modeling) and environmental planning.

Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization: Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first PCA axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. PCA axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual PCA for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining PCA axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of `soft' traits and `hard' traits: The validity of PCA axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors (`hard' traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. PCA axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on PCA axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion: We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.},

  title = {Are Growth Forms Consistent Predictors of Leaf Litter Quality and Decomposability across Peatlands along a Latitudinal Gradient?},
  volume = {93},
  issn = {1365-2745},
  abstract = {1 Plant growth forms are widely used to predict the effects of environmental changes, such as climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition, on plant communities, and the consequences of species shifts for carbon and nutrient cycling. We investigated whether the relationship between growth forms and patterns in litter quality and decomposition are independent of environmental conditions and whether growth forms are as good as litter chemistry at predicting decomposability. 2 We used a natural, latitudinal gradient in NW Europe as a spatial analogue for future increases in temperature and nitrogen availability. Our screening of 70 species typical of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands showed that leaf litters of Sphagnum mosses, evergreen and deciduous shrubs, graminoids and forbs differed significantly in litter chemistry and that the ranking of the growth forms was independent of the region for all litter chemistry variables. Differences among growth forms were usually larger than differences related to the environmental gradient. 3 After 8 and 20 months incubation in outdoor, Sphagnum-based decomposition beds, growth forms generally differed in decomposability, but these patterns varied with latitude. Sphagnum litters decomposed slower than other litters in all regions, again explaining its high representation in organic deposits of peatlands. Forb litters generally decomposed fastest, while the differences among the other growth forms were small, particularly at higher latitudes. 4 Multiple regression analyses showed that growth forms were better at predicting leaf litter decomposition than chemical variables in warm-temperate peatlands with a high N-load, but less so in the subarctic, low-N region. 5 Our results indicate that environmental changes may be less important in determining ecosystem leaf litter chemistry directly than are their indirect effects through changes in the relative abundance of growth forms. However, climatic and nutritional constraints in high-latitude peatlands promote convergence towards nutrient-efficient plant traits, resulting in similar decomposition rates of vascular growth forms despite differences in litter chemistry. The usefulness of the growth-form concept in predicting plant community controls on ecosystem functioning is therefore somewhat limited.},

  abstract = {Transect measurements, continuous monitoring, and synoptic surveys were used to examine patterns in light availability, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentrations within and outside emergent vegetation zones in Goose Lake Marsh, a natural prairie pothole wetland in central Iowa. Water column light availability was less than 2\% of ambient light in emergent vegetated areas due to canopy cover, small floating plants (lemnids), and plant litter. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations were significantly lower and varied less diurnally in vegetated areas. Three habitat zones could be identified based on patterns in vegetation and dissolved oxygen: (1) a zone of dense emergent macrophytes providing significant submerged structure but with nearly or completely anoxic water, (2) a transition zone of sparse emergent macrophytes providing less structure but with more aerobic water, and (3) an open water zone with consistently acrobic water but with little submerged structure. Vegetation patterns are likely to control major aspects of wetland biogeochemistry and trophic dynamics, and wetlands should be viewed as complex mosaics of habitats with distinct structural and functional characteristics.},

Distinguishing valley bottoms from hillslopes is an important first step in identifying and characterizing sediment deposits for hydrologic and geomorphic purposes. Valley bottoms occur at a range of scales from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in extent. This paper describes an algorithm for using digital elevation models to identify valley bottoms based on their topographic signature as flat low-lying areas. The algorithm operates at a range of scales and combines the results at different scales into a single multiresolution index. This index classifies degrees of valley bottom flatness, which may be related to depth of deposit. The index can also be used to identify groundwater constrictions and to delineate hydrologic and geomorphic units.},

  abstract = {We used available field survey and literature data to produce inventory maps of wetland biomass and net primary production (NPP) for western Siberia. Field survey data were obtained for major types of wetland microlandscapes within the boreal (taiga) region. We developed a multiscale approach based on using a regional wetland typology map (1:2,500,000 scale), further refined by satellite image classifications (LANDSAT-7, SPOT, RESURS, 1:200,000 scale). Satellite images on test areas designated in the boreal region of western Siberia were classified by 30 landscape classes. We used aerial photography (1:25,000 scale) to evaluate the fraction of the area occupied by microlandscape elements within patterned wetlands. As a result, we were able to produce a GIS map-based inventory of ecosystem phytomass and NPP in west Siberian wetlands. Using the GIS map, the average and total net primary production and biomass were estimated by ecosystem type, the number of vegetation layers, and climatic gradient. The annual NPP to live biomass ratio increases southward from 0.27 in the tundra to 0.65 in the steppe region. Live biomass of wetlands amounts to only 10\textendash{}30\% of the average biomass of upland forests in the same climatic region, although wetland NPP was found to be equal or higher then that of upland forests. Mosses and the belowground fraction of grasses are the major contributors to NPP. Average live biomass and NPP in wetlands were estimated to be 1600 g/m2 and 790 g/m2/yr, respectively. Total wetland NPP amounts to 530 Tg/yr, and live biomass amounts to 1070 Tg.},

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.The Alvarado Lagoon System (ALS) is a wetland complex in the Gulf of Mexico, with different types of wetlands. We studied six wetland types that differ in species composition and dominant life forms: Rhizophora-Avicennia mangrove, Pachira aquatica freshwater forested wetland, Sabal mexicana flooded palm forest, two broad-leaved marshes (Pontederia sagittata marsh in Rio Blanco; Pithecellobium-Spartina marsh in Popoyeca) and a cattail (Typha domingensis) marsh. The hydroperiod data indicate that all wetland types are flooded for several months of the year, the palm forest having the longest period of time without inundation. Significantly higher (p{$\leq$}0.05) carbon stocks at a depth of 1 m and soil water storage were recorded for the forested wetlands (60 {$\pm$} 6 kg C m-2, 889 L m-3 respectively) and P. sagittata broad-leaved marshes (67 {$\pm$} 9 kg C m-2, 882 L m-3). The lowest values were recorded for the flooded palm forest (16 {$\pm$} 5 kg C m-2, 533 L m-3) and the mangrove (16 {$\pm$} 2 kg C m-2, 463 L m-3). This makes the ALS an important provider of ecosystem services, most notably via its freshwater forested wetlands and marshes. Draining these wetlands for agricultural purposes could lead to differing degrees of change in the soil's hydraulic characteristics, such as a decrease in its capacity to retain water and the loss of organic matter, and therefore a reduced capacity for carbon storage.},

  abstract = {Understanding the association between soil organic carbon (SOC) and texture under different climatic conditions is important for assessing the effects of future climate changes on SOC stocks. In this study, we conducted a climatic gradient experiment covering three climate types (humid, sub-humid, and semi-arid) with a steep rainfall ranging from 345 to 910 mm, and specifically determined SOC dynamics, clay content, and vegetation and soil characteristics. The results showed that, from semi-arid to humid regions, SOC stocks, SOC, and clay content increased synchronously and were closely related in layers of depths of both 0\&ndash;10 and 10\&ndash;20 cm. In contrast, under similar climatic conditions, SOC dynamics were mainly affected by vegetation and soil characteristics, especially total nitrogen and total phosphorus dynamics, but not the soil clay content. Therefore, these results suggest that the relationship between SOC stocks and clay content depended on scale sizes. Specifically, on a larger scale with different climatic gradients, the climate may partly determine the changes in SOC and clay dynamics, whereas, at a smaller scale where climate type does not vary considerably, the changes in SOC stocks and clay content may be related to vegetation diversity and soil nutrient dynamics. These results may contribute to future model development and the projection of changes in soil carbon storage.},

  title = {Maximum Ambient Temperature Can Influence Carbon Storage in {{Vertosols}} Sown with Cotton-Based Farming Systems},
  volume = {64},
  issn = {1836-5795},
  abstract = {Partial mitigation of global warming caused by accelerated emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide may be possible by storing atmospheric carbon in soils. Carbon storage is influenced by processes and properties that affect soil aggregation, such as clay and silt concentrations and mineralogy, intensity and frequency of wet/dry cycles, and microbial activity. Microbial activity, in turn, is influenced by factors such as temperature, nutrient and water availability, and residue quality. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of average annual maximum temperature on soil carbon storage in Vertosols under cotton-based farming systems. This paper reports a re-evaluation of results obtained from a series of experiments on cotton-farming systems conducted in eastern Australia between 1993 and 2010. The experimental sites were in the Macquarie and Namoi Valleys of New South Wales, and the Darling Downs and Central Highlands of Queensland. Average soil organic carbon storage in the 0\textendash{}0.6 m depth was highest in a Black Vertosol in Central Queensland and lowest in a Grey Vertosol that was irrigated with treated sewage effluent at Narrabri. At other sites, average values were generally comparable and ranged from 65 to 85 t C/ha. Climatic parameters such as ambient maximum temperature, Tmax, and rainfall at rainfed sites (but not irrigated sites) were also related to soil organic carbon storage. At most sites, variations in carbon storage with average ambient maximum temperature were described by Gaussian models or bell-shaped curves, which are characteristic of microbial decomposition. Carbon storage occurred at peak rates only for a very limited temperature range at any one site, with these temperatures increasing with decreasing distance from the equator. The exception was a site near Narrabri that was irrigated with treated sewage effluent, where the relationship between soil organic carbon and Tmax was linear. The decrease or absence of change in soil carbon storage with time reported in many Australian studies of annual cropping systems may be due to carbon storage occurring within a limited temperature range, whereas intra-seasonal average maximum temperatures can range widely. Further research needs to be conducted under field conditions to confirm these observations.},

  title = {Clay and Climate Are Poor Predictors of Regional-Scale Soil Carbon Storage in the {{US Caribbean}}},
  volume = {354},
  issn = {0016-7061},
  abstract = {Soils of the tropics play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle as substrates for the most productive terrestrial ecosystems and as large C reservoirs. The amount of C stored in a soil is affected by soil properties such as texture, pH, and mineralogy, as well as climate, vegetation and land management, yet, uncertainty remains regarding the relative importance of these variables at different spatial scales. The goal of this study was to explore the factors influencing regional patterns in soil C storage. Soils were collected from 36 sites under four land cover types (forests, pastures, croplands and wetlands) and on 30 soil series in seven soil orders, representing the diversity in soil forming factors and major non-urban landscapes in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Soils were analyzed at three depths, 0\textendash{}30 cm, 30\textendash{}100 cm, and 0\textendash{}100 cm, for total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (N). Traditional predictors of soil C storage such as clay content and climate were not sufficient to accurately capture regional soil C trends. The combination of clay plus fine silt was positively correlated with SOC stocks but explained a relatively small amount of the variation. Site temperature and mean annual precipitation were not correlated with SOC stocks. Soil order and land cover were weak predictors of SOC for a subset of data where forests and pastures were found on three of the same soil orders, allowing for a two-way ANOVA. Soil N showed similar trends as SOC. Patterns observed depended on the soil depth studied, reflecting relative differences in the strength of top-down and bottom-up factors influencing SOC and N storage. These findings suggest that mechanisms not described by the distribution of soil particle sizes need to be considered for better predictions of SOC dynamics. In a geologically diverse region, soil properties were better predictors of SOC than climate or land cover. Tropical regions represent a diversity of soil types yet parent material and soil physical properties other than texture are not currently included in most biogeochemical models attempting to predict the response of tropical soil C pools to environmental change. Recognition of the heterogeneity of geologic substrates and weathering gradients in tropical regions and incorporation of a more mechanistic understanding can improve soil C modeling and land management decisions.},
