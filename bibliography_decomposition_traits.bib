  abstract = {Response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to global climate change can have important implications to future environment. Soil organic carbon models that provide reliable predictions of SOC change in response to changing management, vegetation, and climatic conditions can serve as useful tools for developing and assessing land management practices that improve soil quality and sustainability and promote soil carbon sequestration. Most models of SOC dynamics based on the concepts of homogeneous SOC compartments face the problem of disconnection between conceptual kinetic SOC compartments and measurable SOC fractions. In addition, most kinetic parameters cannot be determined experimentally for specific site and soil conditions. Feng (2009) developed a new theoretical framework of SOC dynamics based on three fundamental assumptions: the possibility of steady state, linearity, and rate-time equivalence. A single SOC decomposition function, the R function, forms the basis of SOC prediction. This article develops the mathematical theory of a process-based, continuous model (K-model) of the R function. The model is developed by considering three basic steps in SOC decomposition: the initial decomposition of plant litter and utilization of its carbon by soil microorganisms, death of microorganisms, and decomposition and recycling of dead microbial residues. Death of microorganisms and subsequent decomposition of the dead microbial residue form a continuous cycle (the MD cycle) that leads to stabilization of C in soils. The model identifies a specific set of parameters that can be determined experimentally, making possible for site-specific parameterization and simulation.},

  abstract = {Radiocarbon measurements have been used in combination with ``bomb 14C'' models to estimate turnover of soil organic carbon fractions. However, the bomb 14C models assume that all SOC fractions are formed directly from external inputs of carbon, which is not always valid because some SOC fractions may receive carbon from other SOC fractions. Due to the continuous inputs of organic carbon, we argue that the most appropriate way to describe the age of SOC is by an age distribution. We developed age distributed models of SOC fractions and derived analytical solutions to them. The models all assume that SOC fraction decay can be described by first-order kinetics, but differ in their assumptions about the pathway of SOC fraction formation. The solutions can be used to estimate age distributions at steady state of different SOC fractions based on their radiocarbon content. These age distributions can be used to calculate the mean age, mean residence time, and other vital statistics of each measurable SOC fraction. Furthermore, if a sequential scheme is used to isolate the SOC fractions, an estimated age distribution of the total SOC can be obtained by adding the contributions of each soil fraction. The age distributions can be very helpful in interpretations of soil organic carbon dynamics in different soils.},

  abstract = {[Aim To compare the internal balances of nutrients and the rates of nutrient cycling across nine cocoa agroforestry systems consisting of various combination of soil types (Latosols and Cambisols), production systems (cabruca and Erythrina glauca-shade) and fertilization regimes in southern Bahia, Brazil. Methods We measured nutrient stocks in litter fall production, in the accumulated litter and fruits. The internal nutrient balance for various simulations was obtained by the following expressions: (1) Balance 1=litter - fruit (seeds and husks) and (2) Balance 2=(litter+husks) - seeds. Annual litter decomposition coefficients (k) and subsequent potential of nutrient release were also investigated. The data were analyzed by principal components analysis and by Pearson correlations. Results There was a high degree of dissimilarity among the cocoa agrosystems in relation to the nutrient cycling and the internal nutrient balance. The mean annual litterfall production ranged from 4.6 to 8.5 Mg/ha, and the amount of accumulated litter ranged from 7.7 to 16.8 Mg/ha. The results showed significant differences in quality among litter from cocoa agroforests; the decomposition coefficient of litter and the subsequent nutrient release were regulated by the litter quality. In general, the cocoa-erythrina system presented a higher capacity to recycle nutrients compared to the cocoa-cabruca system, with the cocoa-erythrina system having the largest transfer rate of nutrients through litterfall, high values for the decomposition coefficient of litter and the lowest values for the Mean Residence Time of nutrients. Cocoa tree leaves functioned as a sink of nutrients, while shade tree leaves functioned predominantly as a source. The nutritional reserves of litter+ cocoa fruit husks, with respect only to the nutrients exported in the seeds, the balance was positive for all nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) in all agroforests, which emphasizes the potential productive capacity of these agroforests to sustain the estimated production in different harvest cycles. Conclusions The internal balance of nutrients reflects an agroforests's productive capacity, which accumulated litter and cocoa fruit husks may be important nutrient sources that could enable the development of fertilizer recommendation systems aimed at increasing the efficiency of fertilizer use and at maintaining soil fertility in cocoa agroforests. Therefore, further research is needed to develop nutritional balance systems integrating litter+fruits stock and other nutrient pathways (e.g., soil quality, biological N fixation, leaching), which were not measured, for making recommendations regarding liming and fertilizers that are suitable for highly complex biological agrosystems, such as cocoa agroforests that have low levels of elements exported during seed production.]},

  abstract = {Large wood, both live and dead, is essential for producing complex habitat in many streams, especially in forested watersheds that support salmonid populations. The addition of engineered wood structures is a common approach taken in many streams where past watershed management practices have resulted in reduced wood loading. We examined six 300-m stream reaches in the Lagunitas Creek watershed, Northern California, to determine (i) the distribution of large wood in the bankfull channel and 10-year floodplain, (ii) the influence of large wood on the size and distribution of pools and (iii) whether streams with engineered wood structures had greater diversity of pool habitat to support salmonid populations. We found that the amount of large wood in the bankfull channel and the amount available for recruitment from the 10-year floodplain were highly variable among and within reaches examined and largely dependent on the local geomorphic setting. Stream reaches with engineered wood structures had elevated pool frequencies relative to reaches without these structures, suggesting a higher capacity to support salmonids during critical life stages. Among large wood pieces that had a strong influence on pool formation, 23\% had an attached root wad and 66\% were part of a cluster. All of the study reaches we examined had lower volumes of large wood in their bankfull channels than similar stream types with natural wood-loading levels, suggesting that increased additions of large wood could provide ecosystem benefits over time. These principles can be understood and transferred effectively to other watersheds using a framework of wood-loading process domains. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We initiated year-long incubation experiments (22.5\textdegree{}C) to evaluate the CO2 and CH4 production potentials of sedge meadow substrates under field moist and inundated treatments from five sites in the Upper Midwest, USA (4 reference, 1 restored). C mineralization potentials decreased with depth (tussocks{$>$}underlying soil), and were positively correlated with macro-organic matter content and negatively with lignin. Across sites, C stored in tussocks and soil at the restoration was the least stable, suggesting that the restoration of C-storage function may take decades. Mineralization potentials were similar between field moist and inundated treatments, but inundation resulted in higher methane production, accounting for 24\textendash{}51\% of total carbon mineralized from tussocks. In the field however, C. stricta tussocks emitted less methane (393{$\pm$}76mgCH4m-2d-1) than tussock interspaces (1362{$\pm$}371mgCH4m-2d-1) early in the growing season; we suggest that tussock tops oxidized methane produced from deeper anoxic horizons. Our results highlight the importance of considering how microtopography modulates greenhouse gas flux from wetlands and suggests that the C stored in the older, more decomposed C. stricta tussock sedge meadow substrates (both within and between sites) is relatively stable.},

  abstract = {* 1The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary.
* 2We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters.
* 3To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability.
* 4We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes.
* 5This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

  abstract = {In this study, we used data from temperate grassland plant communities in Alberta, Canada to test two longstanding hypotheses in ecology: 1) that there has been correlated evolution of the leaves and roots of plants due to selection for an integrated whole-plant resource uptake strategy, and 2) that trait diversity in ecological communities is generated by adaptations to the conditions in different habitats. We tested the first hypothesis using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for evidence of correlated evolution of suites of leaf and root functional traits in these grasslands. There were consistent evolutionary correlations among traits related to plant resource uptake strategies within leaf tissues, and within root tissues. In contrast, there were inconsistent correlations between the traits of leaves and the traits of roots, suggesting different evolutionary pressures on the above and belowground components of plant morphology. To test the second hypothesis, we evaluated the relative importance of two components of trait diversity: within-community variation (species trait values relative to co-occurring species; {$\alpha$} traits) and among-community variation (the average trait value in communities where species occur; {$\beta$} traits). Trait diversity was mostly explained by variation among co-occurring species, not among-communities. Additionally, there was a phylogenetic signal in the within-community trait values of species relative to co-occurring taxa, but not in their habitat associations or among-community trait variation. These results suggest that sorting of pre-existing trait variation into local communities can explain the leaf and root trait diversity in these grasslands.},

Here, we examined the relationships between analogous above? and belowground traits, including chemical (tissue C and N concentrations) and morphological traits (thickness and diameter, specific leaf area and root length, and tissue density) of 154 species sampling from eight subtropical and temperate forests. Our results showed that N concentrations of leaves and absorptive roots were positively correlated independent of phylogeny and plant growth forms, whereas morphological traits between above? and belowground organs varied independently. These results indicate that, different from plant economics spectrum theory, there is a complex integration of diverse adaptive strategies of plant species to above? and belowground environments, with convergent adaptation in nutrient traits but divergence in morphological traits across plant organs. Our results offer a new perspective for understanding the resource capture strategies of plants in adaptation to heterogeneous environments, and stress the importance of phylogenetic consideration in the discussion of cross?species trait relationships.},

An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

  shorttitle = {Priming Effect},
  abstract = {Understanding how ecosystems store or release carbon is one of ecology's greatest challenges in the 21st century. Organic matter covers a large range of chemical structures and qualities, and it is classically represented by pools of different recalcitrance to degradation. The interaction effects of these pools on carbon cycling are still poorly understood and are most often ignored in global-change models. Soil scientists have shown that inputs of labile organic matter frequently tend to increase, and often double, the mineralization of the more recalcitrant organic matter. The recent revival of interest for this phenomenon, named the priming effect, did not cross the frontiers of the disciplines. In particular, the priming effect phenomenon has been almost totally ignored by the scientific communities studying marine and continental aquatic ecosystems. Here we gather several arguments, experimental results, and field observations that strongly support the hypothesis that the priming effect is a general phenomenon that occurs in various terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. For example, the increase in recalcitrant organic matter mineralization rate in the presence of labile organic matter ranged from 10\% to 500\% in six studies on organic matter degradation in aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, the recalcitrant organic matter mineralization rate may largely depend on labile organic matter availability, influencing the CO{$_{2}$} emissions of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We suggest that (1) recalcitrant organic matter may largely contribute to the CO{$_{2}$} emissions of aquatic ecosystems through the priming effect, and (2) priming effect intensity may be modified by global changes, interacting with eutrophication processes and atmospheric CO{$_{2}$} increases. Finally, we argue that the priming effect acts substantially in the carbon and nutrient cycles in all ecosystems. We outline exciting avenues for research, which could provide new insights on the responses of ecosystems to anthropogenic perturbations and their feedbacks to climatic changes.},

  volume = {98},
  issn = {0022-0477},
  abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a 'plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic 'leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}Evidence is growing that leaf litter generally decomposes faster than expected in its environment of origin, owing to specialization of litter and topsoil decomposer communities to break down litter encountered most often. Nevertheless, this home-field advantage (HFA) in decomposition is inconsistently supported by experimental data and fails to account for situations where contrasting qualities of litter coexist within the same litter matrix. 2.\hspace{0.6em}In contrast to the HFA hypothesis, which expects a positive interaction between every litter species produced locally and the local decomposer communities irrespective of litter species quality, we define here an alternative substrate quality\textendash{}matrix quality interaction (SMI) hypothesis that expects a continuum from positive to negative interaction between specific litters (substrates) and decomposer communities as specific litters and the ecosystem litter layer (i.e. the matrix, which drives local decomposer community composition) become increasingly dissimilar in quality. 3.\hspace{0.6em}To test this hypothesis, we conducted a reciprocal transplant decomposition experiment of eight leaf, six fine-stem and nine fine-root litter species from three neighbouring ecosystems of the subarctic biome: dry forest, riparian forest and forest-surrounded pond; and characterized the quality (represented by lignin content and an integrated measure of carbon/nutrient economics) of each litter species and each ecosystem litter layer. 4.\hspace{0.6em}We found substantial overall effects of SMI on decomposition rates of leaf (20\% explained variance), stem (14\%) and root (15\%) litters, although this effect was lower than the single effects of litter quality and microclimate (remaining explained variance). Despite being partly inconsistent across litter species, likely due to the complexity of litter quality\textendash{}decomposer community relationships, the SMI hypothesis appeared more broadly applicable than the HFA hypothesis. 5.Synthesis.\hspace{0.6em}We demonstrate here that plant traits, likely via their control on litter and topsoil decomposer community composition, have indirect effects on litter breakdown rates, not only at the interface between ecosystems but also within ecosystems, with likely implications for many other ecosystems world-wide. These results suggest functional variation in decomposer communities between ecosystems with respect to their efficiency to degrade litters with contrasting qualities, such as different lignolytic and detoxification activities but also contrasting efficiencies to degrade non-recalcitrant tissues.},

  doi = {10.1890/03-0405},
  abstract = {Most predictions of plant species effects on ecosystems are based on single traits (e.g., litter chemistry) or suites of related traits (functional groups). However, recent studies demonstrate that predictions of species effects on ecosystems are improved by considering multiple traits. In order to develop this multiple trait approach, it is critical to understand how these multiple traits vary in relation to one another among species. The ecosystem effects of traits that strongly covary can likely be summarized by one of these traits. In contrast, it will be necessary to determine the ecosystem effects of specific trait combinations for those traits that vary independently across species. In the field, I established monocultures of eight herbaceous species common in California annual grasslands. Plant species significantly differed in their litter quantity and quality, live biomass, and effects on soil labile C, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Species effects on soil moisture and temperature were only significant at the times of the growing season when each of these limited plant and microbial activity. Some of these traits correlated with one another, such as litter biomass and species effects on soil temperature during the winter. However, for the most part, plant species exhibited unique combinations of these traits. For example, species with similar litter chemistry had the largest differences in plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil labile C. Species rankings for many traits changed over the growing season (e.g., biomass), so that the relationship among traits varied seasonally. The independent variation of these traits suggests that predictions of plant species effects on ecosystems will likely be enhanced by an understanding of how the ecosystem effects of plant traits may vary depending on the combination of traits.},

In this study, we fitted statistical models to explain landscape-scale variation in soil microbial community composition using data from 180 sites covering a broad range of grassland types, soil and climatic conditions in England. We found that variation in soil microbial communities was explained by abiotic factors like climate, pH and soil properties. Biotic factors, namely community-weighted means (CWM) of plant functional traits, also explained variation in soil microbial communities. In particular, more bacterial-dominated microbial communities were associated with exploitative plant traits versus fungal-dominated communities with resource-conservative traits, showing that plant functional traits and soil microbial communities are closely related at the landscape scale.},

  abstract = {* Decomposition of plant litter is a key process in the global carbon cycle, and its realistic representation is essential for accurate prediction of ecosystem carbon and nutrient dynamics. Traditionally, the exponential decay model, which assumes a constant relative decomposition rate through time, has been widely used for both the analysis of empirical data and large-scale modelling. While this model may be adequate in some contexts, there are also many empirical observations for which it does not fit the data well.

* Using a number of previously published leaf and wood decomposition data sets, comprising a diverse selection of litters, we compared the performance of five simple decay models varying in complexity and functional form. To accomplish this, we used a combination of model selection criteria and out-of-sample extrapolation analyses.

* Model selection criteria favoured an optimal balance between parsimony and flexibility, and a rarely used model built on the Weibull distribution proved to have sufficient flexibility to fit the full range of decomposition trajectories including litters that show an initial lag phase. Using the Weibull fits, we further showed that the litter N content affects the shape of the decomposition trajectory, a novel biological result. Out-of-sample extrapolation showed biased predictions for all models and estimates of steady-state stocks were often highly sensitive to model choice.

* As the field moves beyond the single-pool exponential framework, it is useful to confront alternate models with data from a wide array of litter types. This analysis demonstrates that model flexibility is important for representing the wide array of possible decomposition dynamics encountered in nature, with lag phase dynamics more widespread than previously thought. Out-of-sample extrapolation and derived parameters that rely on it remain problematic with all tested models. Progress in understanding the drivers and consequences of litter decomposition will come from combining empirical approaches with more focused process-based modelling that allow for the assessment of alternative model assumptions.},

  abstract = {The colonization of land by plants appears to have coincided with the appearance of mycorrhiza-like fungi. Over evolutionary time, fungi have maintained their prominent role in the formation of mycorrhizal associations. In addition, however, they have been able to occupy other terrestrial niches of which the decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter is perhaps the most remarkable. This implies that, in contrast to that of aquatic organic matter decomposition, bacteria have not been able to monopolize decomposition processes in terrestrial ecosystems. The emergence of fungi in terrestrial ecosystems must have had a strong impact on the evolution of terrestrial bacteria. On the one hand, potential decomposition niches, e.g. lignin degradation, have been lost for bacteria, whereas on the other hand the presence of fungi has itself created new bacterial niches. Confrontation between bacteria and fungi is ongoing, and from studying contemporary interactions, we can learn about the impact that fungi presently have, and have had in the past, on the ecology and evolution of terrestrial bacteria. In the first part of this review, the focus is on niche differentiation between soil bacteria and fungi involved in the decomposition of plant-derived organic matter. Bacteria and fungi are seen to compete for simple plant-derived substrates and have developed antagonistic strategies. For more recalcitrant organic substrates, e.g. cellulose and lignin, both competitive and mutualistic strategies appear to have evolved. In the second part of the review, bacterial niches with respect to the utilization of fungal-derived substrates are considered. Here, several lines of development can be recognized, ranging from mutualistic exudate-consuming bacteria that are associated with fungal surfaces to endosymbiotic and mycophagous bacteria. In some cases, there are indications of fungal specific selection in fungus-associated bacteria, and possible mechanisms for such selection are discussed.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms for C stabilization in soils have received much interest recently due to their relevance in the global C cycle. Here we review the mechanisms that are currently, but often contradictorily or inconsistently, considered to contribute to organic matter (OM) protection against decomposition in temperate soils: (i) selective preservation due to recalcitrance of OM, including plant litter, rhizodeposits, microbial products, humic polymers, and charred OM; (ii) spatial inaccessibility of OM against decomposer organisms due to occlusion, intercalation, hydrophobicity and encapsulation; and (iii) stabilization by interaction with mineral surfaces (Fe-, Al-, Mn-oxides, phyllosilicates) and metal ions. Our goal is to assess the relevance of these mechanisms to the formation of soil OM during different stages of decomposition and under different soil conditions. The view that OM stabilization is dominated by the selective preservation of recalcitrant organic components that accumulate in proportion to their chemical properties can no longer be accepted. In contrast, our analysis of mechanisms shows that: (i) the soil biotic community is able to disintegrate any OM of natural origin; (ii) molecular recalcitrance of OM is relative, rather than absolute; (iii) recalcitrance is only important during early decomposition and in active surface soils; while (iv) during late decomposition and in the subsoil, the relevance of spatial inaccessibility and organo-mineral interactions for SOM stabilization increases. We conclude that major difficulties in the understanding and prediction of SOM dynamics originate from the simultaneous operation of several mechanisms. We discuss knowledge gaps and promising directions of future research.},

  abstract = {* 1The chemical composition of plant litter is commonly considered to indicate its quality as a resource for decomposer organisms. Litter quality, defined in this way, has been shown to be a major determinant of litter decomposition rates both within and across terrestrial ecosystems. Notably, the structure of the microbial community that is directly responsible for primary decomposition is rarely considered as an empirical predictor of litter decay rates.
* 2Microbial communities are generally assumed to perceive litters of the same chemical composition to be of equivalent resource quality but evidence from field studies suggests that these same communities may adapt to the prevalent litter types at a given site. Here, we tested this assumption by assessing how microbial communities sourced from different forest- and herbaceous-dominated ecosystems perceive the quality of novel, foliar litters derived from a tree (Rhododendron maximum) and from a grass (Panicum virgatum) species. Based on chemical composition, we would expect R. maximum litter to be of lower quality than P. virgatum litter.
* 3We used an experimental litter\textendash{}soil system which employs a `common garden' approach and measured rates of CO2 production across 50~days; higher rates of production were assumed to indicate higher quality (i.e. more easily degradable) litter.
* 4We found that communities sourced from habitats under differing plant cover perceived litter quality differently. Those communities sourced from herbaceous habitats perceived the grass litter to be of higher quality than the tree litter, whereas communities from forest habitats decomposed both litter types similarly. Within a litter type, differences in both community composition and nutrient availability of the source habitat were related to decomposition rates.
* 5Our results suggest that litter quality cannot necessarily be predicted solely from chemical characteristics; instead the perceived quality is dependent on the quality of past resource inputs a community has experienced and the structure of those microbial communities responsible for the initial stages of litter decomposition.},

Dolomite is a double carbonate containing calcium and magnesium carbonate in equimolar concentrations. All three carbonates decompose via a single stage process in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The thermal behavior and the kinetics of decomposition were studied using the Arrhenius equation applied to solid-state reactions. It was found that calcite and dolomite supposedly decompose via a zero order mechanism while magnesite decomposes via a first order process. The energy of activation for the decomposition of magnesite, calcite and dolomite were 226.34, 192.50 and 175.05kJ/mol, respectively. Similarly the lnA-values for magnesite, calcite and dolomite decomposition were 30.70, 20.73 and 18.76, respectively. Finally, the effect of procedural variables on the kinetic parameters of dolomite decomposition was investigated. The three procedural variables studied included flow rate, heating rate and sample size. The kinetic parameters and mechanism remain unaffected by a change in these variables.},

With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site dN/dS rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

However, it remains unclear what specific root traits contribute to the three SOM stabilization mechanisms: recalcitrance against decomposition, occlusion in soil aggregates and interaction with soil minerals and metals. This is likely because research is highly fragmented and hampered by disciplinary barriers. By reviewing both plant functional ecology and soil science literature, we identified 18 different traits: architectural, morphological, physiological, symbiotic and chemical root characteristics, influencing the three SOM stabilization mechanisms. We found that traits increasing root recalcitrance promote short term stabilization by slowing decomposition, but that traits reducing recalcitrance contribute to long term stabilization by reaction of microbial products with mineral surfaces. Root length density, mycorrhizal association and rhizodeposition contribute to microaggregation. These and other traits, such as hemicellulose, soluble compounds, and high root branching index, favor macroaggregation. For stabilization by minerals and metals, those root traits promoting higher microbial activity: root nitrogen, hemicellulose and soluble compound concentrations are fundamental, while polyphenols, and litter Al and Mn also contribute to complexification and stabilization. Root depth distribution is the most important trait to control root C storage and stabilization in the subsoil; once roots have reached deeper soil layers, other traits, such as rhizodeposition and root chemistry, influence interaction with minerals and metals. Both mycorrhizal presence and root suberin promote SOC stabilization by means of all three mechanisms, indicating that these are important targets for continued work. Surprisingly, morphological traits commonly measured, namely specific root length and root diameter, poorly relate to stabilization mechanisms. Alternative traits such as chemical composition of the different root orders, root apex characteristics, quantity and quality of rhizodeposits as well as mycorrhizal fungal traits, should be further investigated. For future research, this review highlights the need to evaluate root decomposition and root-C stabilization concomitantly over the long-term, considering simultaneously root litter quality, estimated by root traits, the microbial products and properties of the soil matrix. The information accrued in this review can be used to evaluate the potential of plant species and cultivars to promote SOM stabilization, based on their root traits.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}Global change is likely to alter plant community structure, with consequences for the structure and functioning of the below-ground community and potential feedbacks to climate change. Understanding the mechanisms behind these plant\textendash{}soil interactions and feedbacks to the Earth-system is therefore crucial. One approach to understanding such mechanisms is to use plant traits as predictors of functioning. 2.\hspace{0.6em}We used a field-based monoculture experiment involving nine grassland species that had been growing on the same base soil for 7~years to test whether leaf, litter and root traits associated with different plant growth strategies can be linked to an extensive range of soil properties relevant to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Soil properties included the biomass and structure of the soil microbial community, soil nutrients, soil microclimate and soil process rates. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Plant species with a high relative growth rate (RGR) were associated with high leaf and litter quality (e.g. low toughness, high nitrogen concentrations), an elevated biomass of bacteria relative to fungi in soil, high rates of soil nitrogen mineralization and concentrations of extractable inorganic nitrogen, and to some extent higher available phosphorus pools. 4.\hspace{0.6em}In contrast to current theory, species with a high RGR and litter quality were associated with soils with a lower rate of soil respiration and slow decomposition rates. This indicates that predicting processes that influence carbon cycling from plant traits may be more complex than predicting processes that influence nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. 5.\hspace{0.6em}Root traits did not show strong relationships to RGR, leaf or litter traits, but were strongly correlated with several soil properties, particularly the biomass of bacteria relative to fungi in soil and measures relating to soil carbon cycling. 6.\hspace{0.6em}Synthesis. Our results indicate that plant species from a single habitat can result in significant divergence in soil properties and functioning when grown in monoculture, and that many of these changes are strongly and predictably linked to variation in plant traits associated with different growth strategies. Traits therefore have the potential to be a powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms behind plant\textendash{}soil interactions and ecosystem functioning, and for predicting how changes in plant species composition associated with global change will feedback to the Earth-system.},

  abstract = {The pyrolysis of lignocellulosic materials (pine and eucalyptus woods and pine bark) was previously studied by thermogravimetry with linear temperature programming. The results were successfully modelled by a kinetic scheme consisting of three independent first-order reactions of three pseudo-components. The first and the second pseudo-components correspond to the more-reactive fractions of hemicellulose and cellulose, respectively, and the third includes lignin and the remaining fractions of the carbohydrates. In the present work, the isothermal pyrolysis of lignocellulosic materials (in the temperature range 450\textendash{}700K) was simulated using the previously determined kinetic parameters, yielding their corresponding relative reactivities. The reactivity of each pseudo-component was also studied, and it was found out that the first pseudo-component was completely converted in a very short time at medium and high temperatures, while complete conversion of the second required high temperatures. The reactivity of the third pseudo-component is moderate, even at the highest temperatures. Based on these observations, a method to determine pyrolysis kinetics from isothermal thermogravimetric experiments was developed, whereby the kinetic and composition parameters corresponding to pseudo-components 3, 2 and 1 are successively and independently determined, from high, medium and low temperature experiments, respectively. The method was validated using the isothermal thermogravimetric curves simulated for the three materials.},

A full reciprocal litter transplant study with 16 litter species that varied widely in traits and originated from four forest sites covering a large latitudinal gradient (subarctic to tropics) showed a consistent interspecific ranking of decomposition rates. At a global scale, variation in decomposition was driven by a small subset of litter traits (water saturation capacity and concentrations of magnesium and condensed tannins). These consistent findings, that were largely independent of the varying local decomposer communities, suggest that decomposer communities show little specialisation and high metabolic flexibility in processing plant litter, irrespective of litter origin. Our results provide strong support for using trait-based approaches in modelling the global decomposition component of biosphere-atmosphere carbon fluxes.},

  abstract = {Background:Plant functional traits co-vary along strategy spectra, thereby defining trade-offs for resource acquisition and utilization amongst other processes. A main objective of plant ecology is to quantify the correlations among traits and ask why some of them are sufficiently closely coordinated to form a single axis of functional specialization. However, due to trait co-variations in nature, it is difficult to propose a mechanistic and causal explanation for the origin of trade-offs among traits observed at both intra- and inter-specific level. Methodology/Principal Findings:Using the Gemini individual-centered model which coordinates physiological and morphological processes, we investigated with 12 grass species the consequences of deliberately decoupling variation of leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf lifespan) and plant stature (height and tiller number) on plant growth and phenotypic variability. For all species under both high and low N supplies, simulated trait values maximizing plant growth in monocultures matched observed trait values. Moreover, at the intraspecific level, plastic trait responses to N addition predicted by the model were in close agreement with observed trait responses. In a 4D trait space, our modeling approach highlighted that the unique trait combination maximizing plant growth under a given environmental condition was determined by a coordination of leaf, root and whole plant processes that tended to co-limit the acquisition and use of carbon and of nitrogen. Conclusion/Significance:Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the origin of trade-offs between plant functional traits and further predicts plasticity in plant traits in response to environmental changes. In a multidimensional trait space, regions occupied by current plant species can therefore be viewed as adaptive corridors where trait combinations minimize allometric and physiological constraints from the organ to the whole plant levels. The regions outside this corridor are empty because of inferior plant performance.},

  abstract = {1. River regulation and exotic plant invasion threaten riverine ecosystems, and the two often co-occur. By altering water regimes, flow regulation can facilitate plant invasion by providing conditions that directly benefit invading species, or by reducing competition from native species unsuited to the modified conditions. Integrating water and weed management has the potential to limit riparian plant invasion and maximize the ecological benefit of environmental flows. 2. We surveyed plant communities and modelled flood histories of 24 riparian wetlands along the regulated River Murray, south-eastern Australia. There were no suitable control rivers, so we compared modelled pre- and post-regulation hydrological data to quantify hydrological change in the study wetlands. Regression analyses revealed relationships between hydrological modification and cover of native non-weed, native weed and exotic weed groups and 10 individual species. 3. Exotic cover was highest and native non-weed cover lowest in wetlands that had experienced the greatest change in hydrology \textendash{} a reduction in peak flow. Native weeds did not respond to hydrological modification indicating that exotic species' success was not reliant on their generalist characteristics. 4. By altering habitat filters, hydrological modification caused a decline in amphibious native non-weed species cover and simultaneously provided drier conditions that directly favoured the exotic species group dominated by terrestrial species. Exotic species were potentially further assisted by human-mediated dispersal. 5. Species and functional diversity was inversely related to exotic cover. By shifting the balance between native and exotic taxa and changing community functional composition, flow regulation may disrupt the ecological function and ecosystem services of floodplain wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. Worldwide, flow regulation has led to riverine ecosystems becoming more terrestrial. The success of most introduced plants relies on minimal inundation. In this study, flood magnitude was more important than frequency, timing, or duration for wetland flora because it reflects spatial extent and depth of flooding. Augmenting natural spring floods with environmental flows will kill terrestrial weeds and facilitate native macrophyte growth. Combined with strategies for managing particular amphibious weeds, we recommend flows of 117 000\textendash{}147 000 ML day-1 for at least 2 days every 10 years for River Murray wetland weed management.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-IR spectroscopy applied to soil compositional analysis started to develop markedly in the 1990s, taking advantage of earlier advances in instrumentation and chemometrics for agricultural products. Today, NIR spectroscopy is envisioned as replacing laboratory analysis in certain applications (e.g., soil-carbon-credit assessment at the farm level). However, accuracy is still unsatisfactory compared with standard laboratory procedures, leading some authors to think that such a challenge will never be met. This article investigates the critical points to be aware of when accuracy of NIR-based measurements is assessed. First is the decomposition of the standard error of prediction into components of bias and variance, only the latter being reducible by averaging. This decomposition is not used routinely in the soil-science literature. Contrarily, a log-normal distribution of reference values is very often encountered with soil samples [e.g., elemental concentrations (e.g., carbon)] with numerous small or zero values. These very skewed distributions make us take precautions when using inverse regression methods (e.g., principal component regression or partial least squares), which force the predictions towards the centre of the calibration set, leading to negative effects on the standard error prediction \textendash{} and therefore on prediction accuracy \textendash{} especially when log-normal distributions are encountered. Such distributions, which are very common for soil components, also make the ratio of performance to deviation a useless, even hazardous, tool, leading to erroneous conclusions. We propose a new index based on the quartiles of the empirical distribution \textendash{} ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance \textendash{} to overcome this problem.},

  abstract = {A nongravimetric acetyl bromide lignin (ABL) method was evaluated to quantify lignin concentration in a variety of plant materials. The traditional approach to lignin quantification required extraction of lignin with acidic dioxane and its isolation from each plant sample to construct a standard curve via spectrophotometric analysis. Lignin concentration was then measured in pre-extracted plant cell walls. However, this presented a methodological complexity because extraction and isolation procedures are lengthy and tedious, particularly if there are many samples involved. This work was targeted to simplify lignin quantification. Our hypothesis was that any lignin, regardless of its botanical origin, could be used to construct a standard curve for the purpose of determining lignin concentration in a variety of plants. To test our hypothesis, lignins were isolated from a range of diverse plants and, along with three commercial lignins, standard curves were built and compared among them. Slopes and intercepts derived from these standard curves were close enough to allow utilization of a mean extinction coefficient in the regression equation to estimate lignin concentration in any plant, independent of its botanical origin. Lignin quantification by use of a common regression equation obviates the steps of lignin extraction, isolation, and standard curve construction, which substantially expedites the ABL method. Acetyl bromide lignin method is a fast, convenient analytical procedure that may routinely be used to quantify lignin.},

Mortality variation across species is thought to be influenced by different factors relative to variation within species. The unified model provided here separates mortality rates into growth-dependent and growth-independent hazards. This model creates the opportunity to simultaneously estimate these hazards both across and within species. Moreover, it provides the ability to examine how species traits affect growth-dependent and growth-independent hazards. We derive this unified mortality model using cross-validated Bayesian methods coupled with mortality data collected over three census intervals for 203 tropical rainforest tree species at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We found that growth-independent mortality tended to be higher in species with lower wood density, higher light requirements, and smaller maximum diameter at breast height (dbh). Mortality due to marginal carbon budget as measured by near-zero growth rate tended to be higher in species with lower wood density and higher light demand. The total mortality variation attributable to differences among species was large relative to variation explained by these traits, emphasizing that much remains to be understood. This additive hazards model strengthens our capacity to parse and understand individual-level mortality in highly diverse tropical forests and hence to predict its consequences.},

  abstract = {[The influence of inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs on decomposition is poorly understood. Some prior studies suggest that N may reduce the decomposition of substrates with high concentrations of lignin via inhibitory effects on the activity of lignin-degrading enzymes, although such inhibition has not always been demonstrated. I studied the effects of N addition on decomposition of seven substrates ranging in initial lignin concentrations (from 7.4\% to 25.6\%) over five years in eight different grassland and forest sites in central Minnesota, USA. I predicted that N would stimulate the decomposition of lignin-poor substrates but retard the decomposition of lignin-rich substrates. Across these sites, N had neutral or negative effects on decomposition rates. However, in contrast to my hypothesis, effects of N on decomposition were independent of substrate initial lignin concentrations, and decomposition of the lignin fraction was unaffected by N fertilization. Rather, substrate\textemdash{}site combinations that exhibited more rapid decomposition rates in the control treatment were affected more negatively by addition of N fertilization. Taken together, these results suggest that decreased decomposition with added N did not result from inhibition of lignin-degrading enzyme activity, but may have resulted from abiotic interactions between N fertilizer and products of microbial degradation or synthesis or from N effects on the decomposer community. Low initial substrate N concentrations and N fertilization both stimulated N immobilization, but the differences among substrates were generally much larger than the effects of fertilization. This study suggests that atmospheric N addition could stimulate ecosystem carbon sequestration in some ecosystems as a result of reduced rates of forest floor decomposition.]},

  abstract = {[I investigated the relationship between leaf physiological traits and decomposition of leaf litter for 35 plant species of contrasting growth forms from a lowland tropical forest in Panama to determine whether leaf traits could be used to predict decomposition. Decomposition rate (k) was correlated with specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) across all species. Photosynthetic rate per unit mass (Amass) was not correlated with k, but structural equation modeling showed support for a causal model with significant indirect effects of Amass on k through SLA, N, and P, but not K. The results indicate that the decomposability of leaf tissue in this tropical forest is related to a global spectrum of leaf economics that varies from thin, easily decomposable leaves with high nutrient concentrations and high photosynthetic rates to thick, relatively recalcitrant leaves with greater physical toughness and defenses and low photosynthetic rates. If this pattern is robust across biomes, then selection for suites of traits that maximize photosynthetic carbon gain over the lifetime of the leaf may be used to predict the effects of plant species on leaf litter decomposition, thus placing the ecosystem process of decomposition in an evolutionary context.]},

  abstract = {The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

There are two difficulties apart from the demonstrability issue itself: (1) multiple regression is plagued by collinear relationships in X; and (2) any regression is designed to produce a function that in some way minimizes the overall difference between the observed and 'predicted' Ys, which does not necessarily equate to determining probable influence in a multivariate setting. Problem (1) may be explored by comparing two avenues, one in which a single 'best' regression model is sought and the other where all possible regression models are considered contemporaneously.

The procedure is nonparametric and can be applied to any automated model building technique. It can also provide important diagnostic information about influential cases in the dataset and the stability of the model. Two experiments were conducted using cross-validation to estimate forecast skill in different predictive models of North Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The results indicate that bias, or artificial predictability (defined here as the difference between the usual hindcast skill and the forecast skill estimated by cross-validation), increases with each decision\textemdash{}either screening of potential predictors or fixing the value of a coefficient\textemdash{}drawn from the data. Bias introduced by variable screening depends on the size of the pool of potential predictors, while bias produced by fitting coefficients depends on the number of coefficients. The results also indicate that winter SSTs are predictable with a skill of about 20\%\textendash{}25\%. Several models were compared. More flexible ones which allow the data to guide the selection of variables generally show poorer skill than the relatively inflexible models where a priori variable selection is used. The cross-validation estimates of artificial skill were compared with estimates derived from other methods. Davis and Chelton's method showed close agreement with the cross-validation results for a priori models. However, Monte Carlo estimates and cross-validation estimates do not agree well in the case of predictor screening models. The results of this study indicate that the amount of artificial skill depends on the amount of true skill, so Monte Carlo techniques which assume no true skill cannot be expected to perform well when there is some true skill.},

  abstract = {Plant species differ in many functional traits that drive differences in rates of photosynthesis, biomass allocation, and tissue turnover. However, it remains unclear how-and even if-such traits influence whole-plant growth, with the simple linear relationships predicted by existing theory often lacking empirical support. Here, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the effect of diverse functional traits on plant growth and shade tolerance by extending a widely used model, linking growth rate in seedlings with a single leaf trait, to explicitly include influences of size, light environment, and five prominent traits: seed mass, height at maturation, leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area, and wood density. Based on biomass growth and allocation, this framework explains why the influence of traits on growth rate and shade tolerance often varies with plant size and why the impact of size on growth varies among traits. Specifically, we demonstrate why for height growth the influence of: (i) leaf mass per unit leaf area is strong in small plants but weakens with size; (ii) leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area does not change with size; (iii) wood density is present across sizes; (iv) height at maturation strengthens with size; and (v) seed mass decreases with size. Moreover, we show how traits moderate plant responses to light environment and also determine shade tolerance, supporting diverse empirical results.},

  abstract = {Quantifying how functional traits relate to environmental gradients provides insight into mechanisms governing species distributions. Here, we bring together the fields of species distribution modelling and functional trait ecology with hierarchical modelling by explicitly incorporating traits into a multi-species distribution model. We combined traits from the leaf-height-seed strategy scheme (specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass) with a distribution model for 20 eucalypt taxa in Victoria, Australia. The key insight of this approach is how traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients. The strongest link was between SLA and percent rock cover (species with low SLA had positive responses to rockiness, whereas high SLA species responded negatively to rockiness). We found evidence for complex yet potentially important interactions. For instance, the probability of species occurrence increased with rainfall and solar radiation on average yet the response varied depending on species height and SLA. Tall species were predicted to increase with rainfall and solar radiation across the range of SLA values (tall species with low SLA were especially sensitive to rainfall). Short species responded positively to rainfall and solar radiation only if they had low SLA. This framework readily accounts for interactions between combinations of traits and environmental variables unlike multi-step approaches. Further application of this concept will contribute to a generalized mechanistic understanding of how traits influence species distributions along environmental gradients, with implications for understanding the response of species to global change.},

  abstract = {Plants in nutrient poor environments are often characterized by high nutrient resorption resulting in poor litter quality and, consequently, slow decomposition. We used oligotrophic, P-limited herbaceous wetlands of northern Belize as a model system, on which to document and explain how changes in nutrient content along a salinity gradient affect decomposition rates of macrophytes. In 2001 we established a nutrient addition experiment (P, N, and N\&P) in 15 marshes of a wide range of water conductivities (200\textendash{}6000 {$\mu$}S), dominated by Eleocharis spp. To determine what is more important for decomposition, the initial litter quality, or site differences, we used reciprocal litter placement and cellulose decomposition assay in a combined ``site quality'' and ``litter quality'' experiment. Our prediction of the positive effects of P-enrichment on decomposition rate due to both the quality of litter and the site was confirmed. The site effect was stronger than the litter quality although both were highly significant. Strong site quality effect was apparently the result of more active decomposer community in P-enriched plots as supported by finding of higher microbial biomass in litter decomposing there. The strong effect of site quality on decomposition was further confirmed by the cellulose assay. The cellulose decomposition was significantly slower at high salinity sites indicating lower decomposer microbial activity. Litter nutrient N and P content and nutrient ratios were well correlated with decomposition with the best fit found for log C/P. At C/P mass ratio of {$>$}4000 decomposition processes were extremely slow. We hypothesize that in a long run, the increased decomposition will compensate the increase in primary production resulting from increased nutrient loading and there will be no differences in accumulation of organic material between the controls and nutrient enriched plots.},

  volume = {135},
  issn = {0016-7061},
  doi = {10.1016/j.geoderma.2006.01.004},
  abstract = {Carbon sequestration by agricultural soils has been widely promoted as a means of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In many regions agricultural fields are just one component of a complex landscape matrix and understanding the interactions between agricultural fields and other landscape components such as wetlands is crucial for comprehensive, whole-landscape accounting of soil organic carbon (SOC) change. Our objective was to assess the effects of management and erosional history on SOC storage in wetlands of a typical hummocky agricultural landscape in southern Saskatchewan. Wetlands were classed into three land management groups: native wetlands (i.e., within a native landscape), and uncultivated and cultivated wetlands within an agricultural landscape. Detailed topographic surveys were used to develop a digital elevation model of the sites and landform segmentation algorithms were used to delineate the topographic data into landform elements. SOC density to 45 cm was assessed at seven uncultivated wetlands, seven cultivated wetlands, and twelve native wetlands. Mean SOC density decreased from 175.1 mg ha-1 to 30 cm (equivalent mass depth) for the native wetlands to 168.6 mg ha-1 for the uncultivated wetlands and 87.2 mg ha-1 for the cultivated wetlands in the agricultural field. The SOC density of sediment depositional fans in the uncultivated wetlands is high but the total SOC stored in the fans is low due to their small area. The uncultivated wetlands occupy only 11\% of the site but account for approximately 23\% of SOC stores. Re-establishing permanent vegetation in the cultivated wetlands could provide maximum C sequestration with minimum energy inputs and a minimum loss of productive acreage but the overall consequences for the gas emissions would have to be carefully assessed.},
