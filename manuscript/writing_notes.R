# comparin the peak locations, calling them 'labile' and 'recacitrant' peaks
# thinking about perfecnt recalcitrance compared to total amount (== cell + lignin mgs?)

# mechanisms of degradation of lignocellulosic materials 

# FOCUS

# complex and diverse composition
# not just hc, cl, and lg. but extractives, water, inorganic matter, and volatiles. 
# conscutive chemical reactions
# 'under a linear temperature program'
# the results present the most reactive fractions of the pseudo-components
# most reactive hc, cl. and lg along with other carbohydrate extractives
# in some cases include an additional low temperature peak corresponding to soluble carbohydrates, ie
#    sugars.
# 'normalizing variable' that is temp gives initial temp. ==> relevant?
# hc and lg start decomposing at much lower temperatures than cl.
# eucalyptus wood has been characterised by as many as 5 pseudo-components: hc, crystalline and 
#    amorphour cellulose, lignin, and extractives. Barneto et al 2011 found that mass calculated
#    this way matches analytical results


# clear hierarchy of traits of carbon types
# use of TGA for biomass traits
# there already is a economic spectrum for decomposition - of root and other litter material
# mine is what, recalcitrance spectrum

# what are the traits
# what drives those traits? ==> what does the lit say about likely reasons for these traits?
# add bubble to diagram of carbon types for soluble carbohydrates? 
# many reasons for recalcitrance. intersecting axis of variance
# beyond LES
# general decay of these portions is the regular decay equation
# plant traits
# thermal decomposition behaviour of the biomass
# simple and reliable calculation method
# run the glucose and the hc samples in the TGA - what's my TGA called? 

# my main results in 2-5 figures
# trait variation and correspondence between traits and between species
# present and describe
# discuss the PCA
