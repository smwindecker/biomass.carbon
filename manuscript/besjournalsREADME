This is the BibTeX style (.bst) file for the 
following journals by The British Ecological Society:

Functional Ecology
Journal of Animal Ecology
Journal of Ecology
Journal of Applied Ecology

Simply include it in your .tex file with command 

  \bibliography{myreferences}
  \bibliographystyle{besjournals}

where 'myreferences' is actually the file 
'myreferences.bib', which should be your bibliographic 
databank in BibTeX format, of course!  

Please, be aware that this style was pro­duced in­de­pen­dently 
of the British Ecol. So­ci­ety, and has no for­mal ap­proval 
from the Society.

--------------- if you feel like doing a hackers' job:
I have included here also the file 

besjournals.dbj

which is the one used originally to generate functional_ecol.bst 
but should serve for all 4 BES journals. If 
you spot any mistake in the .bst file, you'd better fixing 
it in the .dbj file, instead of trying to fix the .bst file.

Then, make sure you have custom-bib installed and run:

latex besjournals.dbj 

to produce besjournals.bst, and please, let me know!!!

PS: if you publish a paper using this bst file, please be 
kind to mention it in the acknowledgments, and send me a 
pdf of your paper for my records. It may improve the chances
to get my next research grant!
